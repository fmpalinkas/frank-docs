## Purpose

The Traffic Incidents service is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic.

- These web services can be used via RESTful APIs.
- The Traffic Incidents APIs are based on real-time traffic data from [Example Traffic&trade](http://automotive.Example.com/products-services/connected-services/Example-traffic/).

The Traffic API Traffic Incidents service consists of the the following endpoints:
