            <p>
              A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality that ensures one of
              many different security properties of software is being satisfied.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Security requirements are
                  derived from industry standards, applicable laws, and a history of past vulnerabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Security
                  requirements define new features or additions to existing features to solve a specific security
                  problem or eliminate a potential vulnerability.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Security requirements provide a foundation of vetted security functionality for an application.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Instead of creating a custom approach to security for every application, standard security
                  requirements allow developers to reuse the definition of security controls and best practices.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Those same vetted security requirements provide solutions for security issues that have
                  occurred in the past.

          <dd>

              The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project" target="_blank">OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) <img src="bin/images/link.png" class="exlink" alt="- This is an external link." /></a> is a catalog of available security
              requirements and verification criteria.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  OWASP ASVS can be a source of detailed security
                  requirements for development teams.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Security requirements are categorized into different buckets based on a shared higher order
              security function.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                For example, the ASVS contains categories such as authentication, access
                control, error handling / logging, and web services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Each category contains a collection of
                  requirements that represent the best practices for that category drafted as verifiable
                  statements.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

          <dt tabindex="0">Augmenting Requirements with User Stories and Misuse Cases</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The ASVS requirements are basic verifiable statements which can be expanded upon with
              user stories and misuse cases. The advantage of a user story or misuse case is that it ties the
              application to exactly what the user or attacker does to the system, versus describing what
              the system offers to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is an example of expanding on an ASVS 3.0.1 requirement. From the "Authentication
              Verification Requirements" section of ASVS 3.0.1, requirement 2.19 focuses on default
              passwords.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  2.19 Verify there are no default passwords in use for the application framework or any
                  components used by the application (such as “admin/password”).
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This requirement contains both an action to verify that no default passwords exist, and also
              carries with it the guidance that no default passwords should be used within the application.
            </p>

            <p>
              A user story focuses on the perspective of the user, administrator, or attacker of the system,
              and describes functionality based on what a user wants the system to do for them. A user
              story takes the form of "As a user, I can do x, y, and z".
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  As a user, I can enter my username and password to gain access to the
                  application.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  As a user, I can enter a long password that has a maximum of 1023
                  characters.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>When the story is focused on the attacker and their actions, it is referred to as a misuse case.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  As an attacker, I can enter in a default username and password to gain
                  access.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This story contains the same message as the traditional requirement from ASVS, with
              additional user or attacker details to help make the requirement more testable.

          <dt tabindex="0">Implementation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Successful use of security requirements involves four steps. The process includes discovering /
              selecting, documenting, implementing, and then confirming correct implementation of new
              security features and functionality within an application.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt tabindex="0">Discovery and Selection</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The process begins with discovery and selection of security requirements. In this phase, the
              developer is understanding security requirements from a standard source such as ASVS and
              choosing which requirements to include for a given release of an application. The point of
              discovery and selection is to choose a manageable number of security requirements for this
              release or sprint, and then continue to iterate for each sprint, adding more security
              functionality over time.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt tabindex="0">Investigation and Documentation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              During investigation and documentation, the developer reviews the existing application
              against the new set of security requirements to determine whether the application currently
              meets the requirement or if some development is required. This investigation culminates in
              the documentation of the results of the review.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt tabindex="0">Implementation and Test</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              After the need is determined for development, the developer must now modify the
              application in some way to add the new functionality or eliminate an insecure option. In this
              phase the developer first determines the design required to address the requirement, and
              then completes the code changes to meet the requirement. Test cases should be created to
              confirm the existence of the new functionality or disprove the existence of a previously
              insecure option.
            </p>

          <dt tabindex="0">Vulnerabilities Prevented</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Security requirements define the security functionality of an application. Better security built
              in from the beginning of an applications life cycle results in the prevention of many types of
              vulnerabilities.
