The Maps SDK uses JSON file (styles) defining the sources of data to be shown on the map and its
appearance. Styles are compliant with
the [Map Styles Specification](/map-display-api/documentation/mapstyles/map-style-specification).

## Layers

The `layers` property of a style is an array of all the layers the style defines. Each element of
the array contains all the information needed to render a layer. Note that a single element of a
map, such as a road, may consist of several layers. Among the properties of a layer, two are of
particular interest in this context:

- [#sources](#sources)`source` - The name of the source of data for the layer corresponds to a
  child of the `sources` property.
- [#source-layers](#source-layers)`source-layer` - The name of a layer in a vector tile source;
  corresponds to an element of a vector tile.

## Sources

Sources are defined as properties of the `sources` root property of a style. The structure of a
source depends on its type. The style used in the Maps SDK contains three types of source:

- `vector` - vector map and traffic tiles
- `raster` - raster map and traffic tiles
- `geojson` - additional elements such as chevron, gps inaccuracy radius indicator, etc.

## Source layers

The `source layer` property of a layer is mandatory for all layers of the `vector` type. It defines
the element of a vector tile (also called a _layer_) which is the source of data for this layer.

As noted in the [#layers](#layers)Layers section, there are elements of the map that consist of
multiple layers. The layers that constitute such an element might refer to the same source layer.
For instance - the visual representation of a minor local toll road comprises 11 layers - one for
the main part, one for the outline, another one for a road that goes through a tunnel, etc.

Check
the [Map Display API documentation](/map-display-api/documentation/vector/tile)
for a complete list of vector layer sources (layers in a vector tile) used in the SDK.
