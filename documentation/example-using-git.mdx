## Using Git, VSCode, and GitHub

Use Git from the CMD line, VSCode (or your favorite IDE), and the GitHub Pull Request process to create your work environment and technical documentation.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder on your main drive (C:\) to house the documentation.
2. Open the CMD line and navigate to this new folder.
3. Run `git clone` - clone the remote repository in GitHub to my local machine.
4. Run `git checkout` develop, or main, or master - make sure I am on the cloned folder branch.
5. Run `git status` - make sure all is in order.
6. Run `git pull` - pull the latest edition of the remote repo branch to my machine.
7. Run `git checkout -b "new branch title goes here"` - create a new branch to contain the work.
8. Open your VSCode IDE - make sure you will do the work in the new branch created above.
9. Open the folder and files where the work will be done - do the work.

When you finished creating new or editing work in VSCode:

10. Run `git status` - lists all folders and files where work has been done.
11. Run `git add .` - adds all folders and files where work has been done.
12. Run `git commit` - commits the work.
13. Run `git push`- pushes the work to the GitHub remote repository and opens a new Pull Request.

Test the rendering of the work using the GitHub Pull Request PREVIEW tool.

14. Wait for GitHub and Gatsby to approve the code accuracy (HTML5, MDX Markdown, ReactJS Components) of the work.
15. In GitHub, merge the Pull Request to the internal repo (develop, or main, or master).
16. Run `git pull` - pull the merged work to your local machine.
17. In GitHub, merge the Pull Request to the external-facing repo (develop, or main, or master) for publication on the company website.
