## Initialization

There are two ways to perform a search:

1. Create a SearchAPI (android-sdk-search) object
2. Start and bind to a SearchService (android-sdk-search-extensions)

You should use the first option if you want to handle multithreading / orientation changing and
caching by yourself. The second option is dedicated to you if you want to have an easy, out of the
box Android Service which will handle most of the mentioned problems by itself. Both options are
described in the following section. They all use the same public API. In both cases you will need
the appropriate Search API Key. For more information on obtaining and configuring New API Keys
and their configuration, go to the "Getting started" subpage.

A `SearchApi` object is created in the following manner:

<Code>

```java
SearchApi searchApi = OnlineSearchApi.create(context, BuildConfig.SEARCH_API_KEY)
```

```kotlin
private val searchApi = OnlineSearchApi.create(context, BuildConfig.SEARCH_API_KEY)
```

</Code>

The alternative to using a SearchAPI object is to create the SearchService. To do so, first use
SearchServiceManager to create a ServiceConnection object and set SearchServiceConnectionCallback to
react on bind to the service event:

<Code>

```java
searchServiceConnection = SearchServiceManager.createAndBind(getContext(),
        searchServiceConnectionCallback());
```

```kotlin
val searchServiceConnection = SearchServiceManager.createAndBind(context,
    searchServiceConnectionCallback)
```

</Code>

To unbind from SearchService use the following:

<Code>

```java
SearchServiceManager.unbind(getContext(), searchServiceConnection);
```

```kotlin
SearchServiceManager.unbind(context, searchServiceConnection)
```

</Code>

In the preceding example, the SearchFragmentPresenter was chosen to play the role of a listener on a
source callback. An example implementation can be as follows:

<Code>

```java
@Override
public void onBindSearchService(SearchService service) {
    searchService = service;
}
```

```kotlin
override fun onBindSearchService(service: SearchService) {
    val searchService = service
}
```

</Code>

The Android Search API provides simple yet very handy search functionality. An application developer
can implement his own search component using either a classic callback-based approach or use a
reactive search.

the first approach involves using the void search() method, taking the SearchQuery and
FuzzySearchResultListener implementation as parameters. Implementation of FuzzySearchResultListener
should cover the following two methods:

```java
void onSearchResult(FuzzySearchResponse results);
```

```java
void onSearchError(final SearchError error);
```

The methods are calling back a list of SearchResult objects with corresponding content. All poles of
SearchResult have associated getters, so its information is easily accessible.

Another way to subscribe a search response is to use a reactive search method. It returns a
RxJavas `Observable<List<SearchResult>>`. To take advantage of this implementation, one has to
subscribe for it (for instance with a `Disposable<List<SearchResult>>` or
a `Consumer<List<SearchResult>>`.

An example implementation can look like the following code:

<Code>

```java
searchService.search(specification, fuzzyOutcomeCallback);
```

```kotlin
searchService.search(query)
    .subscribeOn(workingScheduler)
    .observeOn(resultScheduler)
    .subscribe(observer)
```

</Code>

Example implementation of subscriber:

<Code>

```java
private FuzzyOutcomeCallback fuzzyOutcomeCallback = new FuzzyOutcomeCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull FuzzyOutcome fuzzyOutcome) {
        lastSearchResult = ImmutableList.copyOf(fuzzyOutcome.getFuzzyDetailsList());
        searchView.updateSearchResults(ImmutableList.copyOf(fuzzyOutcome.getFuzzyDetailsList()));
        searchFinished();
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull SearchException error) {
        searchView.showSearchFailedMessage(error.getMessage());
        searchView.updateSearchResults(ImmutableList.of());
        searchFinished();
    }
};
```

```kotlin
val observer = object : DisposableSingleObserver<FuzzySearchResponse>() {
    override fun onSuccess(fuzzySearchResponse: FuzzySearchResponse) {
        Resource.success(fuzzySearchResponse.results)
    }

    override fun onError(throwable: Throwable) {
        Resource.error(null, Error(throwable.message))
    }
}
```

</Code>

Please note, a consecutive search request cannot be made before its successorâ€™s callback (either
onSearchResult or onSearchError) is received.

Concurrent search requests are not handled in the current version of the Maps SDK for Android, and
an internal error is reported.
