## What is Example's Geocoding API?

The Geocoding API is a powerful tool that converts addresses, such as "109 Park Row, New York, United States," into geographic coordinates (e.g., "lat": 40.71226, "lon": -74.00207). Designed for machine-to-machine interaction, the Example Geocoding API is capable of handling requests from automated systems to geocode addresses that may be incomplete, incorrectly formatted, or contain typos, providing the best possible result.  

It infers geographic information given a textual place description (postal address) and additional (optional) parameters that guide the search. Examples of optional parameters include a list of countries to search for and a location to search around. The main elements in the geographic information include:
- address components
- corresponding geographic coordinates 
- a complete formatted address  

The Geocoding API provides a simple way to make a request and obtain the desired geographic information in JSON or XML formats, depending on the user's preference. Please note that this API does not return Points of Interest (POIs). It consists of the following endpoints:

## Common use cases

- Get the coordinates to locate the place:
  - To deliver or pickup a delivery.
  - To pick up and drop off passengers.
  - Do route planning.
- Address validation/verification.
- Geospatial analysis.
- Data cleaning.
- Data enhancement.
- Get boundaries, geometries.
- Resolve address issues in user apps which are not human-to-machine interactions.
