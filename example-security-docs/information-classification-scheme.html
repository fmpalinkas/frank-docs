      <section class="api">

        <h2 tabindex="0">Overview</h2>
        <p property="description">
          All data handled by a company must be classified into one of four security levels, each of which requires different levels of protection. Employees must be able to identify the security classification of the data they work with. If there are questions as to the level of data classification, employees are required to obtain clarification from their management.
        </p>

        <h2 id="securitylevels" tabindex="0">Security Levels</h2>

        <h3 id="secret" tabindex="0"><span class="red">SECRET</span></h3>

        <p>
          Secret data requires strong security controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification of the data.
        </p>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li><p>Unauthorized access or disclosure of this level of data can result in significant financial losses and/or legal, regulatory, or reputation damage to (<i>Company name</i>).</p></li>
          <li><p>Card Holder Information (including PAN) is ALWAYS considered Secret and should be secured accordingly.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The two categories of Secret data recognized by (<i>Company name</i>) are as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt tabindex="0">Company Secret</dt>
          <dd><p>This is data or information kept by a company that relates to its financials, business strategies, personnel data, legal matters, technical specifications, or other information that could significantly harm (<i>Company name</i>) or its employees if it is not adequately protected.</p></dd>

          <dt tabindex="0">Customer Secret</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This is private information provided directly or indirectly by our customers that is necessary for fulfillment of services provided by (<i>Company name</i>).</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>This includes private consumer information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, etc., and account numbers, information about individual accounts, or any other information that can be individually tracked to a consumer.</p></li>
              <li><p>Various federal and state consumer and privacy laws specify the type of protection required for this information as well as legal agreements with third parties such as credit card issuers, banks, etc.</p></li>
              <li><p>Various federal and state laws, as well as legal agreements with third parties, may dictate the type of protection required for this information.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3 id="confidential" tabindex="0"><span class="purple">CONFIDENTIAL</span></h3>
        <p>
          <i>Confidential information is intended for internal use within (<i>Company name</i>), but is not intended for general disclosure to the public.</i>
        </p>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li><p>Accidental or malicious disclosure of Confidential information to unauthorized parties may require a response from (<i>Company name</i>), but significant damage to the brand of (<i>Company name</i>) or other losses will not result.</p></li>
          <li><p>Confidential information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of works, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, inventories, or amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization, or other information of commercial value</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="public" tabindex="0"><span class="green">PUBLIC</span></h3>
        <p>Public information is intended to be shared with any individual outside (<i>Company name</i>). This includes information included on (<i>Company name</i>)’s web site made available to unauthenticated users, marketing materials, general (<i>Company name</i>) information, etc.</p>

        <h3 id="unclassified" tabindex="0"><span class="blue">UNCLASSIFIED</span></h3>
        <p>If your document does not fit into either of these 3 preceding security levels, mark it as "Unclassified". This will likely be most of the documents you create. If a document is not explicitly marked with a classification or as "unclassified", it will be assumed to be for consumption within (<i>Company name</i>) and with (<i>Company name</i>)'s partners on a need to know basis.</p>

        <h2 id="dataprotectionpolicies" class="break" tabindex="0">Data Protection Policies</h2>
        <p>Secret information is to be secured and protected while in transit over networks and while in storage.</p>

        <h4 id="secretdataintransit" class="top-space" tabindex="0">Secret Data in Transit</h4>
        <p>The following table lists the minimum level of security controls required to protect Secret data while it is in transit over computer networks.

        <h2 id="dataprotectionstandards" class="break" tabindex="0">Data Protection Standards</h2>
        <p>The current Standard for encrypting secret data is Winzip.</p>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li>Files that will be shared over email, file sharing services (e.g., Dropbox), or removable media must be encrypted (password protected).</li>
          <li>
            The encrypted file and the associated encryption/decryption password must be transmitted to the receiving party over <i>two separate communication channels</i>, e.g.,
            <ul class="indent1">
              <li>The file being shared via Drop-box; and</li>
              <li>The decryption password sent via SMS/Text Messaging.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="nonelectronicdataprotection" tabindex="0">Non-electronic Data Protection (paper reports, documents, etc.)</h2>
        <p>
          Employees must label all documents that are Secret:
        </p>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li><p>By using a standard format in page footers, or</p></li>
          <li><p>By stamping each page clearly with a warning.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>All reports that contain Customer Secret data must always be physically secured at (<i>Company name</i>) facilities, and must not leave the premises unless they are reports intended for distribution via authorized delivery channels approved by management.</p>

        <p>Employees must exercise care in protecting (<i>Company name</i>) Business Secret documents when carrying them out of the facility or using them at home or elsewhere.  During travel, (<i>Company name</i>) Business Secret documents should be transported as carry–on baggage and should be kept in hotel–provided safes when possible.</p>

        <p>Secret information on paper must be shredded before disposal or placed in secured bins for bulk shredding.  Bins for waste paper containing Secret information are placed throughout (<i>Company name</i>) facilities.</p>

        <h2 id="servicingofequipmentcontainingsecretdata" tabindex="0">Servicing of Equipment Containing Secret Data</h2>
        <p>When a computer requires service by non–(<i>Company name</i>) technicians, it must be shut down prior to servicing to prevent access to temporary files maintained by the operating system.</p>

        <p>
          Copiers, printers, and other multi–function devices may contain disc drives or other storage media that retain images of every scanned, faxed, and printed document they process.
        </p>
        <ul class="indent">
          <li><p>These images are often retained in an unencrypted file, usually until all available space is used.</p></li>
          <li><p>These storage media must be removed and the media completely wiped or destroyed prior to removing the devices from (<i>Company name</i>) premises.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>When disposing of obsolete computer equipment, ensure that the hard discs are completely wiped of Secret data and software. The software used for erasing secret data must be approved by <a href="mailto:security@(<i>Company name</i>).com">security&#64;(<i>Company name</i>)</a>. </p>

        <h2 id="protectionofconfidentialandpublicdata" tabindex="0">Protection of Confidential and Public Data</h2>
        <p>Data intended for public access does not require any security controls; although access to data may be tracked for valid business purposes and in accordance with our published Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>
          Confidential data requires a basic level of authentication to establish that the user is a current employee of (<i>Company name</i>).
        </p>

        <ul class="indent">
          <li><p>This may be the possession of a badge to gain access to a (<i>Company name</i>) facility, or via remote network access provided via an approved authentication mechanism.</p></li>
          <li><p>Additional levels of authorization may be required to establish membership in a group or role to limit access to Confidential information based upon job function or responsibility as required by management.</p></li>
