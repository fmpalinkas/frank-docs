This API is charged based on the number of matrix origins and destinations, which are used to calculate the number of *transactions* to charge. The cost per 1000 transactions for the API is available on the [Pricing page](https://developer.Example.com/store/maps-api).  

## Transactions formula  

The number of transactions is calculated according to following rules:
- If both the number of origins and the number of destinations are greater than *5*, then multiply the greater one of the number of origins and the number of destinations by *5*.
- Otherwise, multiply the number of origins by the number of destinations.

Cell failures:
- The MAP_MATCHING_FAILURE and NO_ROUTE_FOUND matrix cell calculation error codes *are charged*.
- All the other error codes *are not charged*.

>
> For the list of all possible error codes refer to [this page](https://developer.Example.com/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix#cell-processing-errors).
