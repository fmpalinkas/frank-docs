## What is Example's Map Display API?

The Map Display API is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around mapping. These web services can be used via  [RESTful APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

The offering includes:

- **Raster:** Raster provides map images of the Example high-quality world map in **raster graphics formats (png or jpg)**.
  - Map images are _tiles_ available in **23 zoom levels**.
  - Satellite images are _tiles_ available in **20 zoom levels**.
  - Hillshade images are *tiles* available in **14 zoom levels**.
  - You can use the images provided in the Map Display API Raster Tile endpoint response to display maps in your own web or mobile application.
- **Vector:** Vector provides map images in **vector format**.
  - You can use the images provided in the Map Display API Vector Tile endpoint response combined with your own custom style to draw them as you like.
  - Vector tiles are fully customizable on the client side: you can switch on/off single layers or change style without sending another request.

For detailed geographic coverage information, please see Example's  [Map Display API Market Coverage](/map-display-api/documentation/product-information/market-coverage)  page. The Map Display API consists of the following services with their endpoints:

## Common use cases you can implement

### Display a map

- Of the whole world with zooming and panning.
- Of a specific country.
- At the given location, and show its detailed surroundings.

### Raster API

The Maps Raster API renders map data that is divided into gridded sections called tiles.

- Map tiles are square images (png or jpg format) in various sizes which are available at 23 different zoom levels, ranging from 0 to 22.
- Satellite tiles are square images (jpg only format) with a size of:  **256 x 256 pixels**  and are available at 20 different zoom levels, ranging from 0 to 19.
- Hillshade tiles are square images (png only format) with a size of: <b>514 x 514 pixels</b> and are available at 14 different zoom levels, ranging from 0 to 13.
- For zoom level 0, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level 22, the world is divided into 2<sup>44</sup> tiles.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Raster features</h4> 

- Attractive raster street map images.
- Satellite map images.
- Map tiles are pre-rendered at 23 zoom levels, ranging from one global tile down to 9.5m x 9.5m detailed map images.
- Satellite tiles are available at 20 zoom levels, ranging from one global tile down to 76m x 76m detailed map images.
- Hillshade map images.
- Each image corresponds with a position on an established zoom level grid system used by the WMS-C standard.
- Multiple shields per road.
- Country-specific shields for all covered regions.
- Toll roads marking.

### Vector API

Similar to the Maps Raster API, the Maps Vector API _serves data on different zoom levels_ ranging from 0 to 22. For zoom level 0, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level 22, the world is divided into 2<sup>44</sup> tiles. The Maps Vector Service delivers geographic map data packaged in a vector representation of squared sections called vector tiles.

- Each tile includes pre-defined collections of map features (points, lines, road shapes, water polygons, building footprints, etc.) delivered in one of the specified vector formats.
- The format of the tile is formally described using the [protobuf schema](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Vector features</h4> 

- Attractive vector street map images.
- Served at 23 zoom levels, ranging from one global tile down to 9.5m x 9.5m detailed map images.
- Each image corresponds with a position on an established zoom level grid system used by the WMS-C standard.
- Toll roads marking.
- All labels in country national languages.
