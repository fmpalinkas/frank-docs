## Private Preview Notice

<Blockquote type="announcement" hasIcon>

The Calculate Reachable Range with Shape Detailed (HCP3) service is still in development.
- Open in **Private Preview** for testing purposes.
- Go to the [Private Preview](https://developer.Example.com/private-preview) page to see what this means.

</Blockquote>

## Purpose

The [Calculate Reachable Range](/routing-api/documentation/routing/calculate-reachable-range) service has an unpublished request parameter: `shape`. It is documented here.

## Request data

### HTTP method: `GET`

### Generic request format

- Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets `{ }` **must be replaced** with their values.
- Please see the following <a href="#request-parameters">Request parameters</a> section with the required and optional parameters tables for these values. The generic request format is as follows.

```shell [type=get] [title=URL request format]
https://{baseURL}/routing/{versionNumber}/calculateReachableRange/origin/{contentType}?key={Your_API_Key}
    ...
    &distanceBudgetInMeters={float}
    &shape={string}
    ...
```

```shell [type=get] [title=URL request example]
https://api.Example.com/routing/1/calculateReachableRange/origin/json?key={Your_API_Key}
    ...
    &distanceBudgetInMeters=5000
    &shape=simplified
    ...
```

```shell [type=get] [title=curl command request example]
curl -XGET 'https://api.Example.com/routing/1/calculateReachableRange/origin/json?key={Your_API_Key}
    ...
    &distanceBudgetInMeters=5000
    &shape=simplified
    ...'
```

        Specifies the polygon shape and level of detail.  
        Possible values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            `simplified`: Provides a simplified polygon, good for
            visualizing the general reachable area without too much detail. It may
            have a faster response than other options.
          </li>
          <li>
            `detailed`: Provides a detailed polygon, good for
            visualizing smaller ranges with a high level of detail.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Very complex ranges may return a shape similar to a call using
                `simplified`, or in very rare cases, an even less
                detailed one.
              </li>
              <li>The response may be slower than with other options.</li>
              <li>
                The maximum allowed processing time is reduced while the feature
                is under development.
              </li>
            </ul>
            While this feature is in preview, the following additional limitations
            are enforced:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a distance budget is used, then
                `distanceBudgetInMeters` must be smaller than or
                equal to `498000`.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a time budget is used, then `timeBudgetInSec` must
                be smaller than or equal to `19920`.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a fuel budget is used, then
                `fuelBudgetInLiters * (1.0 /argmin(constantSpeedConsumptionInLitersPerHundredkm))` must be smaller than or equal to `6.64`.
              </li>
              <li>
                If an energy budget is used, then
                `energyBudgetInkWh * (1.0 / argmin(constantSpeedConsumptionInkWhPerHundredkm))` must be smaller than or equal to `6.64`.
              </li>
            </ul>
            These limits are chosen so that the calculation is completed within
            the reduced time limit with a high probability. The limits may be
            increased in the future as the time limit is increased or more
            efficient implementations become available.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Default value: `simplified`
