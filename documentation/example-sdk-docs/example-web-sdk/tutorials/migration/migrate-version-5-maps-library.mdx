title: Migrate from version 5 - the Maps library
---

## Overview of the tutorial

This tutorial covers some basic use cases to help you switch from version 5 of Maps SDK for Web to
the latest one as quickly as possible. We will use code examples to explain the main differences
between the SDKs.

If you are just interested in migrating services you can refer to
the [migration tutorial for services](/maps-sdk-web-js/tutorials/migration/migrate-version-5-services-library).

## Prerequisites

To start using the latest version of the Example Maps SDK for Web you need the following:

- The **Maps library**<br/>
  The Maps SDK for Web can be used in three ways:
  - Downloaded from NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@Example-international/web-sdk-maps
  - With a
    CDN: https://api.Example.com/maps-sdk-for-web/cdn/6.x/&ltversion&gt;/maps/maps-web.min.js -
    NOTE: include the latest version in the URL.
  - Downloaded from here: [Downloads.](/maps-sdk-web-js/overview/product-information/downloads)<br/>
    In this tutorial, we are using a CDN as an example.
- **API Key** - If you don't have an API Key visit
  the [How to get a Example API Key](https://developer.Example.com/how-to-get-Example-api-key) site and
  create one.

## Displaying a map

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="use-all-space">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Map</title>
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"
    />
    <!-- Replace version in the URL with desired library version -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="https://api.Example.com/maps-sdk-for-web/cdn/6.x/<version>/maps/maps.css"
    />
    <style>
      #map {
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="map" class="map"></div>
    <!-- Replace version in the URL with desired library version -->
    <script src="https://api.Example.com/maps-sdk-for-web/cdn/6.x/<version>/maps/maps-web.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      tt.setProductInfo("<your-product-name>", "<your-product-version>")
      tt.map({
        key: "<your-Example-API-Key>",
        container: "map",
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To locally run this example, save the preceding code in a HTML file. Replace ‘&lt;your-api-key&gt;‘
with the API Key you obtained as shown in the Prerequisites section.

Also replace the basePath with the location of the SDK. Assuming that you have saved it next to the
preceding file, the basePath will be _'./sdk'_.

To see the result simply open your HTML file in a browser. If there is any problem you can check the
log in developer tools.

## Initializing a map

The following code initializes a map using a defined center point and zoom level. In this section we
compare the difference between both SDKs.

### Version 5 of the Maps SDK for Web

```javascript
var map = tt.map({
  key: "<your-Example-API-key>",
  container: "map",
  style: "Example://vector/1/basic-main",
  center: [4.899431, 52.379189],
  zoom: 12,
})
```

### Latest version of Maps SDK for Web

```javascript
var map = tt.map({
  key: "<your-Example-API-key>",
  container: "map",
  center: [4.899431, 52.379189],
  zoom: 12,
})
```

The code for both is similar:

- Both map methods return a reference to the map.
- Both use ‘center’ and ‘zoom’ as properties.

Both require the ID of an element to render the map (in this example 'map'). The main difference is
that we do not support schema styles in v6.

The preceding code example shows how to initialize vector map with a default style. To see how to
set another style, please take a look at
the [options.style parameter documentation.](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)

**The new versions of our SDK use the longitude, latitude coordinate order (as opposed to latitude,
longitude) to match GeoJSON.** You will have to change the order of those in all of the parts of
your application where the coordinates are passed as an array.

## Differences in APIs

Here is a summary of the most important updates in the maps library:

- **Removal of tiers and new way of handling traffic** - to understand the new way of displaying
  traffic, please take a look at the documentation of these methods:
  - [showTrafficFlow()](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)
  - [hideTrafficFlow()](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)
  - [showTrafficIncidents()](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)
  - [hideTrafficIncidents()](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)
- **Removal of style schemas** - to understand the new way of setting styles, please take a look at
  the [options.style parameter documentation.](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-web-js/documentation#Maps.Map)
