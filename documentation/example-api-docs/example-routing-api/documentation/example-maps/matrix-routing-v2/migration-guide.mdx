## Matrix Routing v2 API Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate from the Matrix Routing API to the Matrix Routing v2 API.

> **Note:**
> Throughout this guide, the old _Matrix Routing API_ may be referenced as _Matrix Routing v1 API_, _API v1_ or simply _v1_.
> Similarly, the _Matrix Routing v2 API_ may be referenced as _API v2_ or simply _v2_.

### Checklist

- Familiarize yourself with the Matrix Routing v2 API endpoint documentation pages.
- Familiarize yourself with the  [Changes in API limits](#changes-in-api-limits)  presented in this guide.
- Check which v1 parameters you use - some may not be currently supported in v2. For details see the  [Changes in supported parameters](#changes-in-supported-parameters)  section in this guide. If a parameter that you need is not supported, you can let us know using the  [Contact us](https://developer.Example.com/contact-sales)  form.
- Replace v1 synchronous calls with calls from v2. The  [Migration of the synchronous request](#migration-of-the-synchronous-request)  section will be helpful.
- Replace v1 asynchronous calls with calls from v2, keeping in mind that for the asynchronous version there is one more endpoint now and no long polling. The  [Migration of the asynchronous request](#migration-of-the-asynchronous-request)  section will be helpful.
- Update the response handling, including error handling.

## Changes in API limits

Overall, the maximum size of a matrix increases significantly in the Matrix Routing v2 API. However, to have the larger matrices processed, the input must meet some requirements.

The default limits for the Matrix Routing v2 API compared to the limits for the v1 API, together with the requirements, are presented in the following tables.

If you need a higher number of cells,  [contact us]()  to get a personalized offer.

## New charging model  

The Matrix Routing v2 API is charged based on the matrix dimensions.

If both the number of origins and the number of destinations are less than or equal to 5, then multiply the number of origins by the number of destinations to get the number of billable requests. Otherwise, multiply the greater one of the number of origins and the number of destinations by 5 to get the number of billable requests.

Let's have a matrix of size 4 x 5 (4 origins, 5 destinations). Both dimensions are less or equal to 5 so we apply the charging formula by multiplying 4 times 5. It gives 20 billable requests.

Having a matrix of size 8 x 100 (8 origins, 100 destinations), we multiply 100 (greater of two dimensions) by 5 and get 500 billable requests. That's because both origins and destinations dimensions are greater than 5.

Check our  [Pricing page](https://developer.Example.com/store/maps-api)  for request pricing details.  [Contact Sales](https://developer.Example.com/contact-sales)  in case of any additional questions.

## Migration of the synchronous request

This section covers the actions that must be taken to migrate a synchronous Matrix Routing API request to a synchronous Matrix Routing v2 API request.

> Please familiarize yourself with  [changes in API limits](#changes-in-api-limits)  and  [supported parameters](#changes-in-supported-parameters)  first.

### Request

In the Matrix Routing v2 API:

- The path and version change.
- There are no request parameters other than the API Key.
- HTTP headers stay the same.

```shell [type=post] [title=Matrix Routing API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/1/matrix/sync/json?key={Your_API_Key}&routeType=fastest&travelMode=truck&traffic=true&vehicleMaxSpeed=90&departAt=now
```

```shell [type=post] [title=Matrix Routing v2 API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/matrix/2?key={Your_API_Key}
```

> **Tip:**
> Notice that _sync_ disappears from the path in v2.

#### POST Payload  

Below are examples of a matrix in both v1 and v2 API versions. Notice that:  

- The origins and destinations are defined in the same way.
- The configuration defined in the request parameters in v1 moved to the _options_ object in v2.

Matrix Routing API:

```json
{
  "origins": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 45.458546,
        "longitude": 9.15049
      }
    }
  ],
  "destinations": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 48.149853,
        "longitude": 11.499931
      }
    },
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 48.033688,
        "longitude": 11.538226
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Matrix Routing v2 API:  

```json
{
  "origins": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 45.458546,
        "longitude": 9.15049
      }
    }
  ],
  "destinations": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 48.149853,
        "longitude": 11.499931
      }
    },
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 48.033688,
        "longitude": 11.538226
      }
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "departAt": "now",
    "traffic": "live",
    "travelMode": "truck",
    "vehicleMaxSpeed": 90
  }
}
```

### Response  

#### HTTP codes  

The set of HTTP response codes possible for the synchronous endpoint stays the same.

Please refer to  [Synchronous Matrix](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix#http-status-codes)  endpoint documentation for the complete list.

#### Response body

Compared to v1, here are the overall JSON structure of the response body changes in Matrix Routing v2 API:

- The _formatVersion_ field was removed.
- The 2-dimensional _matrix_ array representing the cell results was removed. Instead, a flat array _data_ represents cell results.
- The v1's _summary_ object containing _successfulRoutes_ and _totalRoutes_ was replaced in v2 with the _statistics_ object which contains more detailed info than in v1, including: _totalCount_, _successes_, _failures_ and the _failureDetails_ array, listing the _count_ for each failure _code_ that occurred.

The presentation of each matrix cell result changes:

- The cell results (elements of mentioned flat _data_ array) are, unlike elements of _matrix_ array in v1, indexed using the fields _originIndex_ and _destinationIndex_.
- In v1, the elements of _matrix_ had to match ordering of the cells in the request body. In v2, there is no such guarantee since the elements are, as previously stated, explicitly indexed.
- The _statusCode_ field was removed.
- The _response_ wrapper object was removed.

In the following JSON examples you can see the responses for both Matrix versions for the example requests presented earlier:

> They equally apply to the synchronous and asynchronous versions of the Matrix Routing v2 API.

## Migration of the asynchronous request

This section describes the migration from asynchronous Matrix Routing API to asynchronous Matrix Routing v2 API.

### Asynchronous API changes overview

> Please familiarize yourself with  [changes in API limits](#async-api-limit-changes)  and  [supported parameters](#changes-in-supported-parameters)  first.

In addition to API limits and supported parameters changes there also are the following changes:

#### Fully asynchronous API without long polling

For the asynchronous Matrix Routing v1 API, in the result of a submission, the client would get an _HTTP 303 See Other_ status, redirecting to the result download endpoint.
Then long polling would occur, ending either in result download within _120s_, or an _HTTP 202 Accepted_ status together with a _Location_ header leading to the same result download endpoint, if the processing is not complete yet.

In case of Matrix Routing v2 API, this behavior changes.
In the result of a submission, the client gets a _HTTP 202 Accepted_ status and a  `jobId`  in the JSON response body.
The _jobId_ needs to be extracted and explicitly used to get the status of processing, or to download the results using the respective Matrix Routing v2 API endpoints.

Such fully asynchronous interaction is well suited for larger jobs now supported by Matrix Routing v2 API.

#### Changed data retention period

In the Matrix Routing v2 API, the time for which the asynchronous processing results will be available for download is 24 hours from the moment of completing the job. In v1 of the service, it was 2 weeks.

### Job submission

Let's first look into how the submission of a matrix job changes in Matrix Routing v2 API.

#### Async submission request

Comparing it to its predecessor, in the Matrix Routing v2 API:

- The path and version change.
- There are no request parameters other than the API Key.
- HTTP request headers stay the same.

```shell [type=post] [title=Matrix Routing API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/1/matrix/json?key={Your_API_Key}&routeType=fastest&travelMode=truck&traffic=true&vehicleMaxSpeed=90&departAt=now
```

```shell [type=post] [title=Matrix Routing v2 API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/matrix/2/async?key={Your_API_Key}
```

> **Tip:**
> Notice that _async_ appears as the last element of the path in v2.

#### POST Payload

The following is a JSON example of a matrix in both v1 and v2 versions. Notice that:

- The origins and destinations are defined the same.
- The configuration defined in the request parameters in v1 moved to the options object in v2.

Matrix Routing API:

```json
{
  "origins": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 45.458546,
        "longitude": 9.15049
      }
    }
  ],
  "destinations": [
    {
      "point": {
        "latitude": 48.149853,

  }
}
```

> **Note**: The structure of the submission request JSON payload is the same in both the asynchronous and synchronous Matrix Routing v2 API.

#### Async submission response

In Matrix Routing v2 API, the response to a submission changes:

- Instead of an _HTTP 303 See Other_ redirect with a _Location_ header, in v2 the client gets an _HTTP 202 Accepted_ response (and no _Location_ header).
- The response has a JSON body, containing a _jobId_ field.

Example submission response body:

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1-785bf64e-9161-4d2d-x123-946c1a741adc-0003",
  "state": "Submitted"
}
```

#### Change in behavior on bad input

In the case of bad input in the body, there is a change in behavior between the asynchronous versions of v1 and v2.

- In v1, the client would get an immediate _HTTP 400 Bad Request_ response to the submission request.
- In v2, the client gets an _HTTP 202 Accepted_ and a _jobId_ in the response body, the same as for a correct submission.
- The client can learn about the bad input after checking the _status endpoint_ for that _jobId_.

How the Matrix Routing v1 API would respond to the submission request given an incorrect coordinate value:

```
HTTP 400 Bad Request
{
  "formatVersion": "0.0.1",
  "error": {
    "description": "Could not parse matrixRequest: #/destinations/1/point/longitude: 1112.362832 is not less or equal to 180"
  },
  "detailedError": {
    "code": "BadRequest",
    "message": "Bad Request",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "MalformedBody",
        "message": "Could not parse matrixRequest: #/destinations/1/point/longitude: 1112.362832 is not less or equal to 180",
        "target": "postBody"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

How the Matrix Routing v2 API responds to a submission request given an incorrect coordinate value:

```
HTTP 202 Accepted
{
  "jobId": "a1-785bf64e-9161-4d2d-x123-946c1a741adc-0003",
  "state": "Submitted"
}
```

As mentioned, the client needs to extract the _jobId_ and call the _status endpoint_.
Only then can they learn about the bad input.
The response of such a status call will look like the following JSON example. Read on to learn more about the _status endpoint_.

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1-a0ed1a56-bbc1-427c-9dc7-6f6d4199cf27-0003",
  "state": "Failed",
  "detailedError": {
    "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
    "message": "Bad Request",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "BAD_ARGUMENT",
        "message": "Error(s) detected in POST body",
        "target": "postBody",
        "details": [
          {
            "code": "BAD_ARGUMENT",
            "message": "1112.362832 is not less or equal to 180",
            "target": "postBody:#/destinations/1/point/longitude"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error response**

> **Note:**
> Be sure to also check the  [Error response](#error-response)  section at the end of this guide.
> It equally applies to all of the endpoints of the Matrix Routing v2 API, including Asynchronous Submission.

### Job status

Matrix v1 offered long polling for the result download. However, in practice, a common case is that a client does not want to wait for the result like that. Instead, they prefer to check if the result is ready themselves.
In v1 there was no dedicated endpoint for that, and the client would use the download endpoint and then assume an _HTTP 404 Not Found_ response as _still in progress_. Additionally, such a (long-polling) approach does not fit for larger matrix sizes, now offered by v2.

Matrix v2 fixes these problems by introducing fully asynchronous version of API. After an asynchronous submission, the client should extract the _jobId_ and they can then use the new _status_ endpoint to look up the current state of their job.
Please refer to the  [Asynchronous Matrix Status](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-status)  endpoint documentation page for more information.

Example of a call to the _status_ endpoint:

```shell [type=get]
https://api.Example.com/routing/matrix/2/async/a1-785bf64e-9161-4d2d-x123-946c1a741adc-0003?key={Your_API_Key}
```

> **Tip:**
> Notice that the path part of the call ends with the _jobId_, there's no _state_, _status_ suffix or alike.

And the response looks like this. Notice that a summary of failed cells also is available in the response body:

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1-976c3dab-44cc-4b71-x123-3e27f53d04fd-0003",
  "state": "Completed",
  "statistics": {
    "totalCount": 2,
    "successes": 1,
    "failures": 1,
    "failureDetails": [
      {
        "code": "OUT_OF_REGION",
        "count": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Possible states

- _Submitted_ - the job has been submitted and awaits input validation. This is the state returned on an asynchronous submission.
- _Validated_ - the job has passed input validation and is being processed.
- _Completed_ - processing is complete, the result can be downloaded.
- _Failed_ - processing failed. Additional details may be available in the response to the _status_ call. The result will not be available for download.

### Result download

As mentioned earlier, in v2 the client can first check if the result is available using the  [Job status](#job-status)  endpoint.

#### Request

Compared to v1, in the Matrix Routing v2 API:

- The path and version change.
- There are no request parameters other than the API Key.
- HTTP request headers stay the same.

```shell [type=get] [title=Matrix Routing API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/1/matrix/a1-eb9252cc-b17f-4d80-x123-a7881231a980-0003?key={Your_API_Key}
```

```shell [type=get] [title=Matrix Routing v2 API]
https://api.Example.com/routing/matrix/2/async/a1-976c3dab-44cc-4b71-x123-3e27f53d04fd-0003/result?key={Your_API_Key}
```

> **Tip:**
> Notice that in API v2 _async_ appears before the _jobId_ and that the last element of the path is the term _result_.

#### Response

##### HTTP codes

As previously mentioned, API v2 is now fully asynchronous and the download endpoint does not offer long polling.
For this reason, the download endpoint will not respond with an _HTTP 202 Accepted_ code anymore.

Please refer to the Asynchronous Download  [endpoint documentation](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-download#http-status-codes)  for the complete list.

##### Response body

Compared to v1, the overall JSON structure of the response body changes in the Matrix Routing v2 API are:

- The _formatVersion_ field was removed.
- The 2-dimensional _matrix_ array representing the cell results was removed. Instead, a flat _data_ array represents cell results.
- The v1's _summary_ object containing _successfulRoutes_ and _totalRoutes_ was replaced in v2 with the _statistics_ object which contains more detailed info than in v1, including: _totalCount_, _successes_, _failures_ and the _failureDetails_ array, listing the _count_ for each failure _code_ that occurred.

The presentation of each matrix cell result change:

- The cell results (elements of mentioned flat _data_ array) are, unlike elements of _matrix_ in v1, indexed using the fields _originIndex_ and _destinationIndex_.
- In v1, the elements of _matrix_ had to match ordering of the cells in the request body. In v2, there is no such guarantee since the elements are, as previously stated, explicitly indexed.
- The _statusCode_ field was removed.
- The _response_ wrapper object was removed.

In the following JSON blocks you can see the responses of both Matrix API versions for the example requests presented earlier:

Matrix Routing API:

```json
{
  "formatVersion": "0.0.1",
  "matrix": [
    [
      {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "response": {
          "routeSummary": {
            "lengthInMeters": 492470,
            "travelTimeInSeconds": 22815,
            "trafficDelayInSeconds": 39,
            "trafficLengthInMeters": 8900,
            "departureTime": "2022-09-06T12:46:10+02:00",
            "arrivalTime": "2022-09-06T19:06:25+02:00"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "response": {
          "routeSummary": {
            "lengthInMeters": 494986,
            "travelTimeInSeconds": 23831,
            "trafficDelayInSeconds": 39,
            "trafficLengthInMeters": 8900,
            "departureTime": "2022-09-06T12:46:10+02:00",
            "arrivalTime": "2022-09-06T19:23:20+02:00"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  ],
  "summary": {
    "successfulRoutes": 2,
    "totalRoutes": 2
  }
}
```

Matrix Routing v2 API:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "originIndex": 0,
      "destinationIndex": 0,
      "routeSummary": {
        "lengthInMeters": 492470,
        "travelTimeInSeconds": 22817,
        "trafficDelayInSeconds": 42,
        "trafficLengthInMeters": 8900,
        "departureTime": "2022-09-06T12:44:39+02:00",
        "arrivalTime": "2022-09-06T19:04:55+02:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "originIndex": 0,
      "destinationIndex": 1,
      "routeSummary": {
        "lengthInMeters": 494986,
        "travelTimeInSeconds": 23835,
        "trafficDelayInSeconds": 42,
        "trafficLengthInMeters": 8900,
        "departureTime": "2022-09-06T12:44:39+02:00",
        "arrivalTime": "2022-09-06T19:21:54+02:00"
      }
    }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "totalCount": 2,
    "successes": 2,
    "failures": 0
  }
}
```

## Response with failed cells

Multiple cells can be failed while the response still has an _HTTP 200 OK_ status code, in both the synchronous and asynchronous Matrix Routing v2 API results.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "originIndex": 0,
      "destinationIndex": 0,
      "routeSummary": {
        "lengthInMeters": 492470,
        "travelTimeInSeconds": 22841,
        "trafficDelayInSeconds": 76,
        "trafficLengthInMeters": 15983,
        "departureTime": "2022-09-06T12:50:09+02:00",
        "arrivalTime": "2022-09-06T19:10:50+02:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "originIndex": 0,
      "destinationIndex": 1,
      "detailedError": {
        "code": "CELL_PROCESSING_ERROR",
        "message": "Cell could not be processed",
        "innerError": {
          "code": "OUT_OF_REGION",
          "message": "Input coordinates out of region"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "totalCount": 2,
    "successes": 1,
    "failures": 1,
    "failureDetails": [
      {
        "code": "OUT_OF_REGION",
        "count": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notice that for the failed cells:

- The _originIndex_ and _destinationIndex_ are present.
- The _detailedError_ object is written instead of _routeSummary_.
- The _statistics_ object contains a filled _failureDetails_ array.

Below is a list of error codes that can appear on cell level in the Matrix Routing v2 API:

- BAD_ARGUMENT
- CELL_TIMEOUT
- MAP_MATCHING_FAILURE
- NO_ROUTE_FOUND
- OVER_TRANSACTION_LIMIT
- OUT_OF_REGION (related to  [changes in API limits](#changes-in-api-limits) )
- UNKNOWN

See the  [Asynchronous](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-download#cell-processing-errors)  or  [Synchronous](/routing-api/documentation/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix#cell-processing-errors)  endpoint documentation for details.

> **Note:**
> Keep in mind that NO_ROUTE_FOUND and MAP_MATCHING_FAILURE cell failures are charged like successful route calculations.

## Error response

For any of the v2 endpoints, the structure of an error response body changes in the following way.

- The _formatVersion_ field was removed.
- The _error_ field was removed.
- The _detailedError_ and its structure stay, but the values of _code_, _message_, and _target_ change.

Depending on the v2 endpoint, while the _detailedError_ structure is the same, the possible content may differ. See the following documentation for details:

-  [Synchronous Matrix](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix#error-code-hierarchy) 
-  [Asynchronous Matrix Submission](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-submission#error-code-hierarchy) 
-  [Asynchronous Matrix Status](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-status#error-code-hierarchy) 
-  [Asynchronous Matrix Download](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-download#error-code-hierarchy)

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
