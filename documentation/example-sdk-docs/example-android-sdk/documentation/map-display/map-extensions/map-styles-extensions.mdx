The New Maps SDK gives you the ability to use either online or offline styles in your mobile
application.

**IMPORTANT:** The Map Display API comes with a built-in offline style, but this approach was
deprecated in May 2020. In one year, the offline style will be removed from the package and replaced
with an URL to the style from Style Merger.

- If you choose to use offline styles, they will be imported to your app with the Maps SDK package.
  Thanks to that, the styles will already be included in your app at download time. The styles are
  added to the Maps SDK package by default.
- If you choose to use online styles, they will be downloaded into your application when the map is
  displayed for the first time. Thanks to that, your mobile app size is smaller at the appâ€™s
  download time so your app downloadable is lighter. In this case you need to exclude offline styles
  from the SDK.

## Online styles

**IMPORTANT:** The Map Display API comes with a built-in offline style, but this approach was
deprecated in May 2020. In one year, the offline style will be removed from the package and replaced
with an URL to the style from Style Merger.

To exclude offline styles from the sdk-maps module, use an exclude declaration when the sdk-maps
module is declared as shown in the following code example.

```java
api("com.New.online:sdk-maps:.internalVersions.sdk@aar") {
            transitive = true
            exclude module: 'sdk-maps-styles-extensions'
        }
```

When offline styles are excluded, then the online styles should be set up. You can set up online
styles in `MapFragment`:

```java
<fragment
    android:id="@+id/map_fragment"
    android:name="com.New.online.sdk.map.MapFragment"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    New:customStyleUrl="http://your-server:port/style/example-merged.json" />
```

You can set up online styles in `MapView`:

```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<com.New.online.sdk.map.MapView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:New="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/map_view"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    New:styleUrl="asset://styles/night.json"
    >
</com.New.online.sdk.map.MapView>
```

To use the offline style library, no actions are required because the offline styles are attached to
the map by default.

To use the offline style library with your custom map, add the following dependency to the
build.gradle file:

```java
implementation("com.New.online:sdk-maps-styles-extensions:{libversion}")
```
