## Purpose

Vector Tiles are served in binary format, which uses Google Protocol Buffers as the method of serializing structured data. The serializing algorithm is very effective and as a result Vector Tiles are light-weight.

<dl>
  <dt>
     `Tile` 
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Represents a vector tile as a whole entity. It consists of at least one 
     `TileLayer`.<br />
    If the tile does not contain any relevant data, it contains one layer named  `empty`.
  </dd>
  <br />
  <dt>
     `TileLayer` 
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Part of a  `Tile` , representing one of the layers that can be

## Schema data

Formally, the structure of Vector Tile is described by the  [protocol buffer schema](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview). It allows the generation of C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Objective-C, and C# code based on  [proto file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/proto).

```cpp [title=Schema proto file]
package vector_tile

option optimize_for = SPEED;

message Tile {

    enum GeomType {
        UNKNOWN = 0;
        POINT = 1;
        LINESTRING = 2;
        POLYGON = 3;
    }

    message Value {
        optional string string_value = 1;
        optional float float_value = 2;
        optional double double_value = 3;
        optional int64 int_value = 4;
        optional uint64 uint_value = 5;
        optional sint64 sint_value = 6;
        optional bool bool_value = 7;
        extensions 8 to max;
    }

    message Feature {
        optional uint64 id = 1 [ default = 0 ];
        repeated uint32 tags = 2 [ packed = true ];
        optional GeomType type = 3 [ default = UNKNOWN ];
        repeated uint32 geometry = 4 [ packed = true ];
        optional bytes raster = 5;
    }

    message Layer {
        required uint32 version = 15 [ default = 1 ];
        required string name = 1;
        repeated Feature features = 2;
        repeated string keys = 3;
        repeated Value values = 4;
        optional uint32 extent = 5 [ default = 4096 ];

        extensions 16 to max;
    }

    repeated Layer layers = 3;

    extensions 16 to 8191;
}
```

## Decoding Vector Tile

### Decoding tile geometry

Vector Tile geometry uses the following coordinate system:

- Coordinates are always integers.
- The `(0,0)`point is located in the upper-left corner of the tile.
- The X axis has positive values to the right of the tile.
- The Y axis has positive values to the bottom of the tile.
- The tile may have margin, which is a buffer around the tile in the shape of a square frame.
- In the Traffic API, the size of the margin is by default equal to `0.1` of the width/length of the tile.
- The extent is equal to `4096`, so the value range for X and Y coordinates is from `0` to `4095`.
- If the tile has a margin, the coordinates values range is additionally extended with its value in both directions.

Vector Tile geometry is encoded as an array of 32 bit unsigned integers in the `geometry` field, belonging to the `TileFeature`.

Encoded format has the following structure:

```cpp
[command_and_count][x0][y0]..[xn][yn][command_and_count][x0][y0]..
```

- `command_and_count` contains encoded values of `command` and `count`.
- `[x0][y0]..[xn][yn]` are encoded coordinate `(x,y)` pairs.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Command</h4> 

The value of `command` is decoded as follows:

```cpp
command = command_and_count & 0x7
```

- It can be interpreted as "paint brush movement" during rendering, in relation to point `(0.0)` and previous commands.
- In the first `TileFeature` `command` "paint brush" starts at point `(0,0)`.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Count</h4> 

The value of `count` is decoded as follows:

```cpp
count = command_and_count >> 0x3
```

- It defines the `n` number of `[xn][yn]` encoded coordinate pairs following the `command_and_count` value.
- These coordinate pairs must be interpreted according to the preceding `command` type.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Coordinates</h4> 

Coordinates `[x0][y0]..[xn][yn]` are encoded in zigzag encoding and are relative to the previous coordinate pair and previous commands. This means that only the first coordinate pair `[x0][y0]` in first command in every `TileFeature` stores absolute values.

The coordinates are decoded as follows:

```cpp [title=Decoded coordinates values]
decode(x0) = ((x0 >> 0x1) ^ (-(x0 & 0x1)))
decode(y0) = ((y0 >> 0x1) ^ (-(y0 & 0x1)))

decode(x1) = decode(x0) + ((x1 >> 0x1) ^ (-(x1 & 0x1)))
decode(y1) = decode(y0) + ((y1 >> 0x1) ^ (-(y1 & 0x1)))

...

decode(xn) = decode(xn-1) + ((xn >> 0x1) ^ (-(xn & 0x1)))
decode(yn) = decode(yn-1) + ((yn >> 0x1) ^ (-(yn & 0x1)))
```

```cpp [title=Example of decoded coordinates]
input :
layer : 0 :
    feature : 0 :
    type : POINT
    geometry : [9, 1136, 6564]

processing :
    geometry :
        command_and_count = 9

        command = 9 & 0x7 = 1
        count = 9 >> 0x3 = 1

        x0 = 1136, y0 = 6564
        decode(x0) = ((1136 >> 0x1) ^ (-(1136 & 0x1))) = 568
        decode(y0) = ((6564 >> 0x1) ^ (-(6564 & 0x1))) = 3282

output :
layer : 0 :
    feature : 0
    geometry : POINT(561, 3282)
```

### Decoding tile tags

In order to reduce tile size, the properties of each feature are encoded in a `tags` array.

- The `tags` array contains integer values which are indexes of `keys` and `values` arrays belonging to the corresponding layer.
- The size of a `tags` array is always even.
- The content of a `tags` array can be grouped into a list of pairs. Each odd element of an array is the first element of a pair, and each even element of an array is the second element of a pair.
- The first element of each pair should be mapped to a `keys` array.
- The second element of each pair should be mapped to a `values` array.
- As a result, we get a decoded list of `tags` where the first element is the tag name and the second element is the tag value in the form of `TileValue`.

```cpp [title=Example]
input :
layer : 0 :
    "keys" : ["road_type", "traffic_road_coverage"],
    "values" : ["Motorway", "full"]
    feature : 0 :
        "tags" : [0,0,1,1]

output :
layer : 0 :
    feature : 0 :
        properties :
        "road_type" : "Motorway"
        "traffic_road_coverage" : "full"
```
