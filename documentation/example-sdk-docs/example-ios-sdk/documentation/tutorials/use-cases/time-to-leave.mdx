## Getting Started

A user can plan their route to reach the destination using the following items:

- Departure and destination locations.
- Travel mode.
- The time they want to reach the destination.
- Optionally preparation time before the departure.

How it works:

1. The route is calculated and displayed on a map.
2. The time to leave timer starts to count down.
3. The route is recalculated each minute to check for any traffic delays.
4. In case of any changes in departure time, the countdown timer is updated and the user is
   notified.

This article does not cover the whole of the application’s code description, only the code sections
where the Example SDK is used.

The application is written in Swift language. If you are interested in Objective-C language, please
check
the [Search along a route](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-ios/tutorials-use-cases/search-along-route)
application.

You can find and clone the working application on
our [GitHub](https://github.com/Example-international/Example-use-case-time-to-leave-ios). Have fun
with modifying it and testing our APIs! If you want to follow a step-by-step application creation
from scratch, check out the “Search Along the Route” tutorial.

The following sections describe the Example:

- Search SDK module to search for addresses
- Map SDK module to display a map
- Routing SDK module to plan routes

## Prerequisites:

1. Clone a [GitHub](https://github.com/Example-international/Example-use-case-time-to-leave-ios)
   repository, with the source code of the TimeToLeave application:
2. If you don't have an API key visit
   a [How to get a Example API key](https://developer.Example.com/how-to-get-Example-api-key) site and
   create one.
3. Copy and paste your API key into a key placeholders inside the _Keys.swift_ file.
   ```swift
   import Foundation
   public class Key: NSObject {
       @objc public static let Map = "Map.Key"
       @objc public static let Routing = "Routing.Key"
       @objc public static let Search = "Search.Key"
       @objc public static let Traffic = "Traffic.Key"
   }
   ```
4. Run _pod install_ command open a newly created _\*.xcworkspace_ file. For more details about this
   step, please see the [downloads](/maps-ios-sdk/documentation/product-information/downloads) section.

## Address & POI search / Typeahead search:

How it works

Results from the Search API query are used to feed departure and destination autocomplete text
fields with the list of suggested positions.

1. The ExampleOnlineSDKSearch package is imported on top of the file so that the `ExampleSearchAPI`
   object can be defined inside the MainViewController class:
   ```swift
   import ExampleOnlineSDKSearch
   let ExampleSearchAPI = TTSearch(key: Key.Search)
   ```
2. The MainViewController class conforms to the `TTSearchDelegate` protocol and assigns itself as a
   delegate in the `ExampleSearchAPI` object:
   ```swift
   class MainViewController: UIViewController, TTSearchDelegate {
       override func viewDidLoad() {
           super.viewDidLoad()
           self.ExampleSearchAPI.delegate = self
       }
   ```
3. Searching is triggered inside the `editingChanged` method every time when editing of the
   departure or destination location has changed and has more than three characters.
   ```swift
   @IBAction func editingChanged(_ textView: UITextField) {
       let enteredText = textView.text
       if enteredText?.count ?? 0 >= 3 {
           let searchQuery: TTSearchQuery = TTSearchQueryBuilder.create(withTerm: enteredText ?? "").withTypeAhead(true).withLang("en-US").build()
           self.ExampleSearchAPI.search(with: searchQuery)
       }
   }
   ```
4. The `TTSearchQueryBuilder` is used to create `searchQuery` object. Because a searched term can be
   partial, the `withTypeAhead(true)` parameter is used to get better results from the search
   engine. Search engine results are handled by one of the two methods:
5. `func search(_ search: TTSearch, completedWith response: TTSearchResponse)`
6. `func search(_ search: TTSearch, failedWithError error: TTResponseError)`
   See the following code example:

   ```swift
   func search(_ search: TTSearch, completedWith response: TTSearchResponse) {
       searchResults.removeAll()
       for result in response.results {
           let resultTuple = (result.address.freeformAddress!, result.position)
           searchResults.append(resultTuple)
       }
       if CLLocationCoordinate2DIsValid(currentLocationCoords) {
           searchResults.append(("-- Your Location --", currentLocationCoords))
           searchResults.sort() { sh.0 < .0 }
       }
       autocompleteTableView?.reloadData()
       autocompleteTableView.isHidden = false
   }

   func search(_ search: TTSearch, failedWithError error: TTResponseError) {
       print(error.description)
   }
   ```

7. When the search query has completed with a successful response a tuple with an address and
   position of that address is created.

Search result addresses are used to create an autocomplete table view so that the user can pick the
correct address from the list which then becomes the departure or the destination position.

When both the departure and the destination positions are set, a user can pick the arrival time,
preparation time and travel mode. These parameters are gathered and passed to the
CountDownViewController using “prepare for segue” method so that application can switch the count
down screen. See the following code example.

```swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    if segue.identifier == self.timeShowSegueIdentifier {
        let destViewController: CountDownViewController = segue.destination as! CountDownViewController
        destViewController.travelMode = travelMode
        destViewController.arriveAtTime = getArrivalDate()
        destViewController.preparationTime = preparationTime
        destViewController.departureLocation = departureCoords
        destViewController.destinationLocation = destinationCoords
    }
}
```

## Example Map display module:

A CountDownViewController uses map and routing modules from the Example Maps SDK.

<ContentWrapper maxWidth="23rem" objectFit="contain">

![](https://developer.Example.com/assets/tutorials/timetoleave-ios/countDown_screen.png)

</ContentWrapper>

1. To start working with Example Map, a user has to import the ExampleOnlineSDKMaps package on top of
   the file.
2. Then, the user:
3. Creates the `TTMapView` object which will be initialized later in the code.
4. Creates the `TTMapStyleDefaultConfiguration` and `TTMapConfiguration` objects in order to pass
   them into the `TTMapView` constructor methods.

The `mapView` object is then initialized inside the `initExampleServices` and `initExampleMap`
methods, where proper constraints together with an insets has been set and `onMapReadyCompletion`
block has been defined.

Inside that block the `mapView` object is fully initialized and the user can start interacting with
it.

In the presented application, user is requesting a route update so that a route can be visualized on
the map. See the following code example.

```swift
import UIKit
import ExampleOnlineSDKMaps
import ExampleOnlineSDKRouting
class CountDownViewController: UIViewController, TTRouteResponseDelegate{
    var mapView: TTMapView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        initExampleServices()
    }

    fileprivate func initExampleMap() {
        let style = TTMapStyleDefaultConfiguration()
        let config = TTMapConfigurationBuilder.create()
            .withMapKey(Key.Map)
            .withTrafficKey(Key.Traffic)
            .withMapStyleConfiguration(style)
            .build()
        self.mapView = TTMapView(frame: self.view.frame, mapConfiguration: config)
        self.view.insertSubview(mapView, belowSubview: countDownView)
        self.mapView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        self.mapView.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.leftAnchor).isActive = true
        self.mapView.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.rightAnchor).isActive = true
        self.mapView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.countDownView.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
        self.mapView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: self.view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor).isActive = true
    }

    fileprivate func initExampleServices() {
        initExampleMap()
        self.ttRoute.delegate = self
        let insets = UIEdgeInsets.init(top: 30 * UIScreen.main.scale, left: 10 * UIScreen.main.scale, bottom: 30 * UIScreen.main.scale, right:10 * UIScreen.main.scale)
        self.mapView.contentInset = insets
        self.mapView.onMapReadyCompletion {
            self.mapView.isShowsUserLocation = true
            self.present(self.progressDialog, animated: true, completion: nil)
            self.requestRouteUpdate()
        }
    }
```

## Example Routing module:

The CountDown view controller uses the Example Routing APIs to perform routing requests and
operations like drawing a route on the map or displaying start and end route icons.

1. First, a `ExampleOnlineSDKRouting` is imported on top of the file, and a `ttRoute` variable is
   declared and initialized. See the following code example.

   ```swift
   import ExampleOnlineSDKMaps
   import ExampleOnlineSDKRouting

   class CountDownViewController: UIViewController{
   var mapView: TTMapView!

   let ttRoute = TTRoute(key: Key.Routing)
   ```

2. Then, the CountDownViewController conforms to the TTRouteResponseDelegate class and can be set as
   a delegate inside the ttRoute object. See the following code example.

   ```swift
   class CountDownViewController: UIViewController, TTRouteResponseDelegate {
   var mapView: TTMapView!

   fileprivate func initExampleServices () {
       self.ttRoute.delegate = self
   ```

3. After assigning a delegate to the CountDownViewController, the “request route update” method can
   be called. See the following code example.
   ```swift
   fileprivate func requestRouteUpdate() {
        let routeQuery = TTRouteQueryBuilder.create(withDest: self.destinationLocation, andOrig: self.departureLocation)
             .withArriveAt(self.arriveAtTime)
             .withTraffic(true)
             .withTravelMode(self.travelMode)
             .withRouteType(.fastest)
             .build()
        self.ttRoute.plan(with: routeQuery)
   }
   ```
4. The `requestRouteUpdate` creates the `routeQuery` object and passes it to the `ttRoute` object
   inside a `plan(with: query )` method as an argument. `TTRouteQueryBuilder` is used to simplify
   building a `routeQuery` object with a few helper methods:

- `withArriveAt` – a date and time of arrival at the destination point. It’s an important method
  inside the application because it changes a departure date which is later used to calculate time
  left before the departure.
- `withTraffic` – when enabled, current traffic information is used during the route planning,
  when disabled – only historical traffic data is used.
- `withTravelMode` – in the application user can choose one of the following: car, taxi or
  pedestrian. Other possible parameters are listed here:
- `withRouteType` – allow the users to select one type of route from: fastest, shortest, thrilling
  or eco.

5. When the `ttRoute.plan(with: routeQuery)` method will be executed, the `ttRoute` object will call
   the `TTRouteResponseDelegate` methods which are implemented inside CountDownViewController.

   ```swift
   func route(_ route: TTRoute, completedWith result: TTRouteResult) {
       func startTimer() {
           self.countDownTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1.0, target: self, selector: #selector(updateTimer), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)
       }

       func drawRouteOnExampleMap(_ route: TTFullRoute) {
           let mapRoute = TTMapRoute(coordinatesData: route, with: TTMapRouteStyle.defaultActive(), imageStart: TTMapRoute.defaultImageDeparture(), imageEnd: TTMapRoute.defaultImageDestination())
           mapView.routeManager.add(mapRoute)
           mapView.routeManager.showRouteOverview(mapRoute)
       }

       func presentTrafficUpdateDialog(message: String) {
           let trafficChangedDialog = initStoryBoardDialog(identifier: "trafficUpdateMessage")
           (trafficChangedDialog as! TrafficUpdateViewController).message = message
           presentTrafficDialog(viewController: trafficChangedDialog)
       }

       func presentTrafficDialog(viewController: UIViewController, for seconds: Double = 3.0) {
           self.present(viewController, animated: true)
           DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: DispatchTime.now() + seconds) {
               viewController.dismiss(animated: true)
           }
       }

       guard let plannedRoute = result.routes.first else {
           return
       }

       self.progressDialog.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
       let newDepartureTime = plannedRoute.summary.departureTime
       self.travelTimeInSeconds = plannedRoute.summary.travelTimeInSecondsValue
       if (self.previousDepartureTime == nil) {
           self.previousDepartureTime = newDepartureTime
           drawRouteOnExampleMap(plannedRoute)
           startTimer()
           updateTimer()
       }
       else if self.previousDepartureTime != newDepartureTime {
           presentTrafficUpdateDialog(message: "Route recalculated due to change in traffic: \(Int(self.previousDepartureTime.timeIntervalSince(newDepartureTime!)))sec")
           self.previousDepartureTime = newDepartureTime
       }
       else if self.previousDepartureTime == newDepartureTime {
           let noTrafficDialog = initStoryBoardDialog(identifier: "trafficNoUpdateMessage")
           presentTrafficDialog(viewController: noTrafficDialog)
       }
   }

   func route(_ route: TTRoute, completedWith responseError: TTResponseError) {
       func displayErrorDialog() {
           let alertDialog = UIAlertController(title: "Error", message: "No routes found satisfying requested time. Please choose different arrival time and try again." , preferredStyle: .alert)
           let dialogAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Dismiss", style: .default, handler:  { _ in
               self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
           })
           alertDialog.addAction(dialogAction)
           self.present(alertDialog, animated: true, completion: nil)
       }

       self.progressDialog.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
       if self.previousDepartureTime == nil {
           displayErrorDialog()
       }
   }
   ```

6. When planning of the route will not succeed, the `route(completedWith error: TTResponseError)`
   method is executed.
7. Inside that method the application creates and display an error dialog to the user.
8. When user taps on the “Dismiss” action the CountDownViewController will be dismissed and the
   application will display its first screen, so that the user can re-plan the route again.
9. When the planning of the route succeeds, the `route(completedWith result: TTRouteResult)` method
   will be called. After receiving routing results, the new departure time is saved and few checks
   are performed:
10. When a `self.previousDepartureTime` variable is `nil`, it means that it’s a first routing call
    since the CountDownViewController did load. In this case:
11. The `drawRouteOnExampleMap` function is called and the route is displayed on the map. See the
    following code example.
    ```swift
    func drawRouteOnExampleMap(_ route: TTFullRoute) {
        let mapRoute = TTMapRoute(coordinatesData: route, with: TTMapRouteStyle.defaultActive(), imageStart: TTMapRoute.defaultImageDeparture(), imageEnd: TTMapRoute.defaultImageDestination())
        mapView.routeManager.add(mapRoute)
        mapView.routeManager.showRouteOverview(mapRoute)
    }
    ```
12. The `startTimer` method initializes and starts a timer with one second interval. Timer will be
    used to count down the time which is left to the departure time. `updateTimer` method will be
    called at each tick of the timer.
    ```swift
    func startTimer() {
        self.countDownTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1.0, target: self, selector: #selector(updateTimer), userInfo: nil, repeats: true)
    }
    ```
13. Lastly, the `updateTimer` method is called to update all count down labels immediately without
    waiting for the one second interval before the first timer tick. Method `updateTimer` will be
    described later.
14. When the `self.previousDepartureTime` variable is different than the newDepartureTime it means,
    that there was an update in traffic conditions. The application saves the `newDepartureTime`
    inside the `self.previousDepartureTime` variable and displays a message to the
    user: ![](https://developer.Example.com/assets/tutorials/timetoleave-ios/traffic_changed_popup.png)
15. When the `self.previousDepartureTime` is the same as the `newDepartureTime` variable it means
    that traffic conditions are the same so there is no action besides displaying the proper dialog
    to the user:
    ![](https://developer.Example.com/assets/tutorials/timetoleave-ios/no_additional_traffic_popup.png)

When the CountDown ViewController is displayed for the first time and route planning has been
finished successfully, the timer is initialized and starts calling the updateTimer method each and
every second. See the following code example.

```swift
@objc func updateTimer() {
    func prepareFinalAlert() -> UIAlertController {
        let timeToLeaveAlert = UIAlertController(title: "Time's UP!", message: "Time to leave!", preferredStyle: .alert)
        let timeToLeaveWhateverAction = UIAlertAction(title: "Whatever", style: .default, handler: { _ in
            let overTimeDialog = self.initStoryBoardDialog(identifier: "overtimeDialog")
            (overTimeDialog as! OverTimeViewController).parentDelegate = self
            self.present(overTimeDialog, animated: true, completion: nil)
        })
        let onMyWayAction = UIAlertAction(title: "On My Way!", style: .default, handler: { _ in
            self.performSegue(withIdentifier: "safeTravelsSegue", sender: self)
        })
        timeToLeaveAlert.addAction(timeToLeaveWhateverAction)
        timeToLeaveAlert.addAction(onMyWayAction)
        return timeToLeaveAlert
    }

    let routeRecalculationDelayInSeconds = 60
    countDownSeconds += 1
    let currentTime = Date()
    if currentTime < previousDepartureTime {
        let timeInterval = DateInterval(start: currentTime, end: previousDepartureTime)
        displayTimeToLeave(timeInterval)

        if countDownSeconds % routeRecalculationDelayInSeconds == 0
            && timeInterval.duration > 5 {
            self.requestRouteUpdate()
        }
    }
    else {
        resetTimer()
        let finalTimeToLeaveAlert = prepareFinalAlert()
        self.present(finalTimeToLeaveAlert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

First, a `countDownSeconds` variable is incremented and a current time is stored in
the `currentTime` variable. Now, there are two cases which will be handled inside the `updateTimer`
function.

1. When the `currentTime` variable occurs earlier than the `self.previousDepartureTime` variable, it
   means that the user still has some time to leave a departure point. To visualize how much time is
   left to leave, time interval between `currentTime` and `previousDepartureTime` is calculated and
   displayed to the user by the `displayTimeToLeave` function. Every 60 seconds timer
   invokes `requestRouteUpdate` function which updates departure times based on the current traffic
   conditions.
2. The second case occurs when the current time is the same or later than
   the `previousDepartureTime`. In that case it means that the timer finished its count down and the
   user should leave the departure position in order to be on the requested arrival time at the
   destination point. The `countDownSeconds` variable is set to zero, and the final dialog is
   displayed to the user.
