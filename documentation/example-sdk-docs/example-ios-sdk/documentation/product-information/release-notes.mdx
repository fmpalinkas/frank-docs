MAP - ExampleOnlineSDKMaps

- \[FEATURE\] Switching key initialization from info.plist to a static initialization via
  constructor
- \[FEATURE\] Give ability to turn on/off Chevron inaccuracy radius
- \[IMPROVEMENT\] Adjusted examples "Map tiles" and "Traffic layers" - presenting functionality of
  hosting resources
- \[FEATURE\] Hosted map and traffic display resources (styles and sprites)

Starting with version 2.4.593, we are switching bundled-in styles and sprite, to using Example hosted
styles and sprites. More information about the new approach is available
in [Map Initialization](https://developer.Example.com/maps-sdk-android/map-initialization).<br />
Thanks to integration
with [Merged Style](/maps-android-sdk/documentation/map-display/documentation/custom-style) method
provided by Map Display API you can generate and use one style for map and traffic display.<br />
The main benefits of Example hosted display resources are as following:<br />

- It makes application download size​ MB smaller in comparison to using bundled-in resources.<br />
- It allows you to get the newest look and feel of the map and traffic.Maps SDK will work with the
  bundled-in style until June 2021 but we recommend to switch to using hosted assets sooner.

UTILS - ExampleOnlineUtils

- \[FIX\] API diffs did not generate

DRIVING EXTENSIONS - ExampleOnlineSDKDriving
