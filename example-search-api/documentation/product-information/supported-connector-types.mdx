			<td>
			<div>CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and industrial partners, therefore also known as the TEPCO&#39;s connector. It supports fast DC charging.</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>GBT20234Part2</td>
			<td>
			<div>China Part 2 connector as defined in the GB/T 20234.2-2015 standard. The name of the standard is sometimes used to refer to the connector (e.g. GB/T part 2 or even GB/T 20234.2). Mostly used in combination with 220V single phase, but can be extended to work with three phase infrastructure.</div>
