## Maintaining the currency of traffic incident tiles

**IMPORTANT:** The Maps SDK should be initialized with the style from Style Merger which only
supports vector tiles. The approach of using a single style that contains both Raster and Vector
tiles was deprecated. After the deprecation period is over, it will not be possible to switch
between Raster and Vector Traffic Incidents without reloading the style.

Traffic incident data provided as map tiles by
the [Vector Incident Tiles](/traffic-api/traffic-api/documentation/traffic-incidents/vector-incident-tiles)
and [Raster Incident Tiles](/traffic-api/traffic-api/documentation/traffic-incidents/raster-incident-tiles)
services is updated periodically to reflect the current state of traffic as closely as possible. It
might happen that the traffic data changes between two requests to the service. In this situation,
always requesting the most recent data may lead to inconsistencies in the visual representation of
traffic. Adjacent tiles may show traffic in different states.

The traffic incident tile services provide a way to synchronize tiles between Requests. If the ID of
a traffic model is supplied in a Requestâ€™s URL, the traffic model specified by that ID is used to
fulfill the Request.
The [Traffic Incident Viewport](/traffic-api/traffic-api/documentation/traffic-incidents/incident-viewport)
service provides the ID of the most recent traffic model shared between all tiles within the
provided viewport. The Maps SDK automatically synchronizes traffic incident tiles displayed on the
map and maintains their currency by periodically requesting a traffic model ID for the current
viewport.

The Maps SDK requests a current traffic model ID from the Traffic Incident Viewport service every 30
seconds as long as the visibility of at least one traffic incident layer is set to `true`. If the
new ID and the current one are different, new traffic incident tiles are requested from the
respective service. All regular charges apply.
