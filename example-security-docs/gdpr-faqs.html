                The GDPR not only applies to organisations located within the EU but it will also apply to organisations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behaviour of, EU data subjects. It applies to all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company’s location.

                  <li><p>This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements e.g., not having sufficient customer consent to process data or violating the core of Privacy by Design concepts.</p></li>

                The GDPR applies to "personal data" meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier. This definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.

                The conditions for consent have been strengthened, as companies will no longer be able to utilise long illegible terms and conditions full of legalese, as the request for consent must be given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose for data processing attached to that consent - meaning it must be unambiguous.
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.</p></li>
                  <li><p>It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.​ </p></li>
                  <li><p>Explicit consent is required only for processing sensitive personal data - in this context, nothing short of “opt in” will suffice.</p></li>

                The type and amount of personal data you may process depends on the reason you are processing it (legal reason used) and what you want to do with it. You must respect several key rules, including:

                <strong>Yes, but only in some cases.</strong>

                <p>The following points should be considered:</p>

                <ol>
                  <li><p>The link between the original purpose and the new/upcoming purpose.</p></li>

                  <li><p>The type and nature of the data (is it sensitive?).</p></li>
                  <li><p>The possible consequences of the intended further processing (how will it impact the individual?).</p></li>
                  <li><p>The existence of appropriate safeguards (such as encryption or pseudonymisation).</p></li>
                </ol>

                <p>If your company/organisation:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Wants to use the data for statistics or for scientific research it is not necessary to run the compatibility test.</p></li>

          <summary>16. For how long can data be kept, and is it necessary to update it?</summary>

                <strong>You must store data for the shortest time possible.</strong>
                <ol>
                  <li><p>That period should take into account the reasons why your company/organisation needs to process the data, as well as any legal obligations to keep the data for a fixed period of time (for example national labour, tax or anti-fraud laws requiring you to keep personal data about your employees for a defined period, product warranty duration, etc.).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Your company/organisation should establish time limits to erase or review the data stored.</p></li>
                  <li><p>By way of an exception, personal data may be kept for a longer period for archiving purposes in the public interest or for reasons of scientific or historical research, provided that appropriate technical and organisational measures are put in place (such as anonymisation, encryption, etc.).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Your company/organisation must also ensure that the data held is accurate and kept up-to-date.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Example: Data kept for too long without an update</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Your company/organisation runs a recruitment office and for that purpose it collects CVs of persons seeking employment and who, in exchange for your intermediary services, pay you a fee.</p></li>
                  <li><p>You plan to keep the data for 20 years and you take no measures for updating the CVs.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The storage period does not seem proportionate to the purpose of finding employment for a person in the short to medium term.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Moreover, the fact you don’t request updates to CVs at regular intervals renders some of the searches useless for the person seeking employment after a certain amount of time (for instance because that person has gained new qualifications).</p></li>

                <p>The information may be provided in writing, orally at the request of the individual when identity of that person is proven by other means, or by electronic means where appropriate.

                <p>When data is obtained from another company/organisation, your company/organisation should provide the information listed above to the person concerned at the latest within 1 month after your company obtained the personal data;</p>
                <ol>

                </ol>

                <p>Your company/organisation is also required to inform the individual of the categories of data and the source from which it was obtained including if it was obtained  from publicly accessible sources.</p>
