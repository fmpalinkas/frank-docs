title: Typeahead parameter
---

Offer your users search suggestions while they type with the "typeahead" flag. Sample use case: You
were recommended a place to visit, but you can’t remember its name. You start searching in your app.
After a few letters you see the place you’re looking for!

Use the following code snippet to try this in your app.

<Code>

```swift
let query = TTSearchQueryBuilder.create(withTerm: term)
    .withTypeAhead(true)
    .build()
search.search(with: query)
```

```objectivec
TTSearchQuery *query = [[[TTSearchQueryBuilder createWithTerm:term] withTypeAhead:YES] build]
[self.search searchWithQuery:query];
```

</Code>
