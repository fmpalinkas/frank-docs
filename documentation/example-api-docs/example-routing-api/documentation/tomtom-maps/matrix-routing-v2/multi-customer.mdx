## Public Preview Notice

<Blockquote type="announcement" hasIcon>

<p>This feature of the Matrix Routing v2 API is in  [Public Preview](https://developer.Example.com/public-preview). If you would like to try it out, please  [contact Sales](https://developer.Example.com/contact-sales).</p>

</Blockquote>

## What is the Multi-Customer feature?

The Matrix v2 service has processing limits per customer.
Customers may want to offer Matrix v2, e.g., via an app or API platform, to their own multiple customers called sub-customers on this page.
The Multi-Customer feature allows every sub-customer to have their own independent limits, so that requests from different sub-customers will not affect each other during processing time.

## How to use the Multi-Customer feature?

This section covers the actions that must be taken to use the Multi-Customer feature in the Matrix Routing v2 API.

>
> **Note:**
> If ```Sub-Customer-ID``` is not provided at all, then Matrix v2 works without the Multi-Customer feature.
>

### Request

In order to use the Multi-Customer feature you should add the **Sub-Customer-ID** header to the regular Matrix v2 requests.
Please be aware that this document does not specify the complete request, but only additional input data.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Header name</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Sub-Customer-ID</th>
      <td>
        Specifies an identifier for the sub-customer.
        <ul>
          <li>It is used to differentiate your customers in the Multi-Customer feature.</li>
          <li>The value must match the regular expression  `'^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,100}$'`.</li>
          <li>The value should not contain sensitive information, because it can be used for tracing. Please consider using the SHA256 hash.</li>
        </ul>  
        **Value:**  An  `identifier`  for the sub-customer.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Error response  

The Matrix v2 may return ```HTTP 400 Bad Request``` while using ```Sub-Customer-ID``` header in the following cases:
- ```Sub-Customer-ID``` header does not match the regular expression  `'^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,100}$'`, for example, the value has a length greater than 100.
- The Multi-Customer feature is not enabled for your API Key. Please  [contact Sales](https://developer.Example.com/contact-sales)  to enable this feature.

#### Example error message  

Please notice the ```subCustomerId``` value in the ```target``` field.  

```
HTTP 400 Bad Request
{
  "detailedError": {
    "code": "BAD_REQUEST",
    "message": "Bad Request",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "BAD_ARGUMENT",
        "message": "You are not allowed to use Sub-Customer-ID header.",
        "target": "subCustomerId",
        "innerError": {
          "code": "ILLEGAL_PARAMETER"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usage scenarios  

The feature can be used with both  [Synchronous](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix)
and  [Asynchronous](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-submission)  Matrix v2 APIs.  

Keep in mind that for the Asynchronous API all the endpoints are affected:
-  [Asynchronous Matrix v2 Submission](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-submission)
-  [Asynchronous Matrix v2 Status](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-status)
-  [Asynchronous Matrix v2 Download](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/asynchronous-matrix-download)

### Synchronous API

Interaction with the Synchronous API is done in a single API call, so it is enough to set the  [```Sub-Customer-ID```](#request)
header for the  [Synchronous Submission](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/synchronous-matrix)  request
in order to have the Multi-Customer feature effective.

### Asynchronous API

The  [```Sub-Customer-ID```](#request)  header must be set for all the asynchronous Matrix endpoints to be effective.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `Sub-Customer-ID`  is provided in the Submission endpoint but not provided in other endpoints. Access is allowed.<br />
        In this case, we decided to allow access to the Matrix v2 result and status without the  `Sub-Customer-ID`  being filled.<br />
        It is up to the Customer to secure the download/status access with the Sub-Customer-Id header, if they find it necessary to make sure
        that one sub-customer won't have access to another sub-customer's matrices.
