title: Zooming the route
---

Zooming in and out are used to navigate through map areas that are too large or too small to be
conveniently displayed within a single window. While following the chevron, zooming alters the map
scale because it changes the proportion of the workspace shown in each window.

Sample use case: You are a taxi driver navigating through the city of Łódź, and thanks to the zoom
level adjusted to the velocity of your car you see a convenient map area for you to move.

Use the following code snippets to try this in your app:

```java
fun setupLocationUpdateListener(NewMap: NewMap) {
    NewMap.addLocationUpdateListener { location ->
        updateZoomLevelBaseOnNewLocation(NewMap, location)
    }
}

private fun updateZoomLevelBaseOnNewLocation(NewMap: NewMap, location: Location) {
    val zoomLevel = when (location.speed) {
        in SMALL_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH -> SMALL_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL
        in MEDIUM_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH -> MEDIUM_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL
        in GREATER_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH -> GREATER_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL
        in BIG_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH -> BIG_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL
        in HUGE_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH -> HUGE_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL
        else -> NewMap.zoomLevel
    }
    if (NewMap.zoomLevel != zoomLevel) {
        setCameraPosition(NewMap, zoomLevel = zoomLevel)
    }
}

private fun setCameraPosition(NewMap: NewMap, zoomLevel: Double) {
    if (!isZooming) {
        isZooming = true
        NewMap.centerOn(
            CameraPosition.builder()
                .zoom(zoomLevel)
                .animationDuration(ZOOM_CHANGE_ANIMATION_MILLIS)
                .build(),
            onMapCenteredCallback
        )
    }
}

private val onMapCenteredCallback = object : OnMapCenteredCallback {
    override fun onFinish() {
        isZooming = false
    }

    override fun onCancel() {
        isZooming = false
    }
}
```

Lookup for the constants used in the sample code:

```java
private const val EXAMPLE_START_ZOOM_LEVEL = 19.0
private const val ZOOM_CHANGE_ANIMATION_MILLIS = 300
private const val SMALL_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL = 19.0
private const val MEDIUM_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL = 18.0
private const val GREATER_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL = 17.0
private const val BIG_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL = 16.0
private const val HUGE_SPEED_ZOOM_LEVEL = 14.0
private val SMALL_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH = 0.0..10.0
private val MEDIUM_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH = 10.0..20.0
private val GREATER_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH = 20.0..40.0
private val BIG_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH = 40.0..70.0
private val HUGE_SPEED_RANGE_IN_KMH = 70.0..120.0
```
