## Deprecation Notice

<Blockquote type="announcement" hasIcon>
   **Oct 14, 2022** 
  <ul>
    <li>The Matrix Routing v1 API is deprecated.</li>
    <li>
      It is replaced by the 
       [Matrix Routing v2 API](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/matrix-routing-v2-service).
    </li>
    <li>
      A 
       [Migration Guide](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing-v2/migration-guide)  
      is available to help with the move to the latest version of the API.
    </li>
    <li>The planned withdrawal date is Oct 14, 2023.</li>
    <li>
      Following withdrawal, requests using this functionality may receive an
      HTTP error in the response.

## Purpose  

The Matrix Routing service enables the calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes defined with origin and destination locations.  

- For every given origin, this service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination.
- The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table, while each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell.  

The following costs are computed for each route:  

- Travel times
- Distances

Use the computed costs to determine which routes to calculate using the  [Routing API](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/product-information/introduction)  suite.

## Asynchronous API overview  

The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests.  

- It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
- The Asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
- The maximum size of a matrix for this API is `700` (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations), so examples of matrix dimensions are: `5x10`, `10x10`, `28x25` (it does not need to be square).

### Data retention period notice  

Please be aware that matrices processed by the Asynchronous API are available for download for 14 days, after which a request for results download will return an HTTP `404` (Not Found) response.

#### Sequence of Asynchronous client actions

1. A client sends a request to the  [Asynchronous Matrix Submission](/routing-api/documentation/matrix-routing/asynchronous-matrix-submission)  endpoint.
2. The server will respond with one of:
  - HTTP 202 or HTTP 303 (depending on `redirectMode` parameter) with the Location header, which points to the  [Asynchronous Matrix Download](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing/asynchronous-matrix-download)  endpoint.
  - An HTTP error. See the  [Asynchronous Matrix Submission HTTP Status codes](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing/asynchronous-matrix-submission#http-status-codes).
3. After getting an HTTP `303` response, the client should follow the redirect to the  [Asynchronous Matrix Download](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing/asynchronous-matrix-download)  endpoint which is a blocking long poll request.
4. The client waits for a matrix response. Possible scenarios are:
  - The matrix response is calculated before timeout (by default 120 seconds, can be changed by `waitTimeSeconds` parameter).
    - The client receives an HTTP `200`.
    - The matrix response is ready and it is being returned to the client.
  - The matrix response is not ready before timeout.
    - The client receives an HTTP `202`.
    - The matrix request is accepted for processing.
    - The client downloads the matrix results from the URL specified by the Location header (see point 3).

## Synchronous API overview

The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight routing requests with quickly-expiring results (e.g., due to changing traffic conditions).

- In such a case, when the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the route summaries of the matrix are calculated, and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later on.
- The Synchronous API will return a timeout error if the request takes longer than 60 seconds.
- The maximum size of a matrix is limited to `100` for this API (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations), so examples of matrix dimensions are: `5x10`, `10x10`, `20x5` (it does not need to be square).

### Sequence of Synchronous Matrix API client actions

1. A client sends a request to the  [Synchronous Matrix](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing/synchronous-matrix)  endpoint.
2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   - An HTTP `200` Matrix processing result. The calculation is finished before timeout and the client downloads the results straight away.
   - An HTTP `408` request timeout error. If the request takes longer than 60 seconds and cannot be finished in this timeframe.
   - Another HTTP error. See the  [Synchronous Matrix HTTP Status codes](/routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/matrix-routing/synchronous-matrix#http-status-codes)  section.
