title: Fuzziness parameter
---

Help your users even more with Fuzzy Search. Use the right fuzziness levels in your app to make it
less sensitive to typos. Sample use case: You occasionally make mistakes when typing. Your app still
returns the desired search results.

Use the following code snippet to try this in your app.

- Level 1 uses no spell checking.
- Level 2 is using normal n-gram spell checking. For example, a query "restrant" can be matched to "
  restaurant".
- Level 3 is using sound-like spell checking and shingle spell checking. Sound-like spell checking
  is for "rstrnt" to "restaurant" matching. Shingle spell checking is for "mountainview" to "
  mountain view" matching.
- Level 4 doesnâ€™t add any more spell checking functionality.

The search engine will start looking for a match on the level defined by minFuzzyLevel and will stop
searching at the level specified by maxFuzzyLevel.

<Code>

```swift
let query = TTSearchQueryBuilder.create(withTerm: term)
    .withMinFuzzyLevel(1)
    .withMaxFuzzyLevel(maxFuzzyLevel)
    .withPosition(locationManager.lastLocation!.coordinate)
    .build()
search.search(with: query)
```

```objectivec
TTSearchQuery *query = [[[[[TTSearchQueryBuilder createWithTerm:term] withMinFuzzyLevel:1] withMaxFuzzyLevel:maxFuzzyLevel] withPosition:self.locationManager.lastLocation.coordinate] build]
[self.search searchWithQuery:query];
```
