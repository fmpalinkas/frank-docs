      <section class="api">

        <h3 id="intro" tabindex="0">Overview</h3>
        <p property="description">
          Information is an essential (<i>Company name</i>) asset and is vitally important to our business operations and delivery of services. (<i>Company name</i>) must ensure that its information assets are protected in a manner that is cost-effective and that reduces the risk of unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction, whether accidental or intentional.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Information Security Program will adopt a risk management approach to Information Security. The risk management approach requires the identification, assessment, and appropriate mitigation of
          vulnerabilities and threats that can adversely impact (<i>Company name</i>)’s information assets.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Information Security Program Charter serves as the "capstone" document for an Information Security Program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope" tabindex="0">1. Scope</h3>
        <p>This Information Security Program Charter and associated policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures apply to all employees, contractors, part-time and temporary workers, and those employed by others to perform work on (<i>Company name</i>) premises or who have been granted access to (<i>Company name</i>) information or systems.</p>

        <p>
          The Information Security Program will attempt to reduce vulnerabilities by developing policies to monitor, identify, assess, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities and threats. The management activities will
          support organizational objectives for mitigating, responding to and recovering from identified vulnerabilities and threats.
        </p>

        <p>The Information Security Program will ensure that the Information Security Program Charter and associated policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures are properly communicated and understood by establishing a Security Awareness Program to educate and train the individuals, groups, and partners covered by the scope of this Charter.</p>
