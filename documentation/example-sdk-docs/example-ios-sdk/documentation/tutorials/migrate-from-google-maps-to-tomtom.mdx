[For Web](/maps-sdk-web-js/tutorials/migration/migrate-google-maps-Example) [For Android](/maps-android-sdk/documentation/tutorials/migrate-from-google-maps-to-Example)

## Overview

This tutorial covers some very basic use cases to help you switch your iOS app from Google's APIs to
Example's as quickly as possible. It starts with basic environment setup, then dives into the code.
At the very bottom of the page is a recommended reading list to allow you to build on the
foundations provided by this tutorial. The application is written in Objective-C language. If you
are interested in Swift language, please check
the [Time to leave](/maps-ios-sdk/documentation/tutorials/use-cases/time-to-leave)
tutorial.

### This tutorial covers:

- [Getting a free API key and creating a local setup for the Example Maps SDK for iOS.](#prerequisites)
- [Initializing and displaying a map.](#initializing-a-map)
- [Adding a traffic layer on top of the map.](#displaying-traffic)
- [Adding a marker.](#displaying-a-marker)
- [Displaying a route.](#displaying-a-routedirections)

## Prerequisites

Before you start writing code, prepare your environment:

1. Ensure that Xcode and iOS simulator are installed.
2. Ensure that [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed on your system. The Example Maps SDK
   for iOS is delivered as a CocoaPods pod.
3. Create a new **Single View App** project in Objective-C language with a deployment target of **
   9.1** or higher. After the project has been successfully created, close it and create an empty
   Podfile by executing a `'pod init'` command inside the project folder.
4. Open the Podfile and paste the following lines inside a 'target' section:

- For Example:
  ```prettyprint
  pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMaps'
  pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKRouting'
  pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMapsUIExtensions'
  ```
- For Google:
  ```prettyprint
  pod 'GoogleMaps'
  ```

5. Save and close the Podfile.
6. Execute the command `'pod install'`. Cocoapods will install all of the required dependencies.
7. Open a `*.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
8. If you don't have an API key visit
   a [How to get a Example API key](https://developer.Example.com/how-to-get-Example-api-key) site and
   create one.

You can find more details on iOS project setup on our blog
article: [Getting Started with the Example Maps SDK for iOS: Project Setup](https://developer.Example.com/blog/build-different/getting-started-Example-maps-sdk-ios-project-setup).

## Initializing a map

Compare how map is initialized using Example and Google APIs:

### Google

To display a map using Google Maps Android API, you need to perform few steps:

1. Inside **AppDelegate.m** import the 'GoogleMaps' module and provide a Google API key (this
   example uses a Clang semantic import):
   ```objectivec
   #import "AppDelegate.h"
   @import GoogleMaps
   @interface AppDelegate ()
   @end
   @implementation AppDelegate
   - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
       [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE"];
       return YES; }
   ```
2. Import the `GoogleSDK.h` header in the _ViewController.m_ file.
   ```objectivec
   #import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>
   ```
3. Initialize a `GMSMapView` object inside the `'viewDidLoad'` method. Assign it to
   our `ViewController` view.
   ```objectivec
   CLLocationCoordinate2D amsterdamCoordinates = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(52.377271, 4.909466);
   GMSCameraPosition *camera = [GMSCameraPosition cameraWithTarget:amsterdamCoordinates zoom:10];
   GMSMapView *mapView = [GMSMapView mapWithFrame:CGRectZero camera:camera];
   self.view = mapView;
   ```

### Example

To display a map in Example Maps SDK for iOS:

1. Import the appropriate header inside the `ViewController.h` file:
   ```objectivec
   #import <ExampleOnlineSDKMaps/ExampleOnlineSDKMaps.h>
   ```
2. Create an NSString constant for the API key inside the `ViewController.m` file and paste your
   newly created key inside the placeholder.

   ```objectivec
   #import "ViewController.h"

   static NSString *const API_KEY = @"YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. Add a `TTMapView` property inside the _ViewController.m_ file. Create
   the `TTMapStyleDefaultConfiguration` and `TTMapConfiguration` objects and use them to initialize
   the map by instantiating the `TTMapView` object and switching the ViewController view to
   the `TTMapView` view.

   ```objectivec
   @interface ViewController ()
   @property TTMapView* mapView;
   @end

   @implementation ViewController
   - (void)viewDidLoad {
       [super viewDidLoad];
       TTMapStyleDefaultConfiguration *style = [[TTMapStyleDefaultConfiguration alloc] init];
       TTMapConfiguration *config = [[[[[TTMapConfigurationBuilder alloc]
              withMapKey:API_KEY]
             withTrafficKey:API_KEY]
         withMapStyleConfiguration:style] build];
       self.mapView = [[TTMapView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame mapConfiguration:config];
       CLLocationCoordinate2D amsterdamCoords = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(52.377271, 4.909466);
       [self.mapView centerOnCoordinate:amsterdamCoords withZoom:11];
       self.view = self.mapView;
   }
   ```

## Displaying a marker

Displaying a marker is similar in both SDKs.

### Google

Create a `GMSMarker` object and assign the current map to it:

```objectivec
GMSMarker *marker = [[GMSMarker alloc] init];
marker.position = amsterdamCoordinates;
marker.map = mapView;
```

### Example

Use a `TTAnnotation` object to display a marker:

```objectivec
TTAnnotation *annotation = [TTAnnotation annotationWithCoordinate:amsterdamCoords];
[self.mapView.annotationManager addAnnotation:annotation];
```

## Displaying traffic

Showing traffic is also similar in both SDKs.

### Google

Use 'setTrafficEnabled' to show traffic on the map:

```objectivec
[mapView setTrafficEnabled:YES];
```

### Example

Example provides two kinds of traffic information:

- **Traffic flow** shows the difference between current and free flow speed. Green indicates that
  the speeds are the same, meaning there are no traffic jams. Red indicates that traffic is much
  slower than free flow, meaning that there are traffic jams.
- **Traffic incidents** indicates specific traffic problems such as closed roads, rain, ice on the
  road, or accidents.

You can show traffic incidents, traffic flow, or both:

```objectivec
self.mapView.trafficIncidentsOn = YES;
self.mapView.trafficFlowOn = YES;
```

## Displaying a route/directions

### Google

Displaying a route in Google SDK is not straightforward. It boils down to interacting with the
Directions API, gathering a list of route positions, then drawing polylines from that list directly
onto the map. This is too verbose and complex to show in this tutorial.

### Example

1. Import the `'ExampleOnlineSDKRouting.h'` header in _ViewController.h_:
   ```objectivec
   #import <ExampleOnlineSDKRouting/ExampleOnlineSDKRouting.h>
   ```
2. Update _ViewController.h_ so that it conforms to the `TTRouteResponseDelegate` protocol.
   ```objectivec
   @interface ViewController : UIViewController <TTRouteResponseDelegate>
       - (void)route:(TTRoute *)route completedWithResult:(TTRouteResult *)result;
       - (void)route:(TTRoute *)route completedWithResponseError:(TTResponseError *)responseError;
   @end
   ```
3. Create and initialize `TTRoute` and `TTRouteQuery` objects inside the `viewDidLoad` method in _
   ViewController.m_.

   ```objectivec
   CLLocationCoordinate2D routeStart = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(52.376368, 4.908113);
   CLLocationCoordinate2D routeStop = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(52.372281, 4.846595);
   TTRouteQuery *routeQuery = [[TTRouteQueryBuilder createWithDest:routeStop andOrig:routeStart] build];
   TTRoute *route = [[TTRoute alloc] init];
   route.delegate = self;
   [self.mapView onMapReadyCompletion:^{
       [route planRouteWithQuery:routeQuery];
   }];
   ```

   The code above builds a `TTRouteQuery` object from two route points. It then initializes
   a `TTRoute` object, sets a delegate to the `ViewController` instance which allows
   the `'completedWithResult'` method to be called. Inside `onMapReadyCompletion` block it sends
   the `'planRouteWithQuery'` message to a newly created `route` object with `routeQuery` as a
   parameter.

4. Finally, provide an implementation for the `'completedWithResult'` method inside of the _
   ViewController.m_ file:

   ```objectivec
   - (void)route:(TTRoute *)route completedWithResult:(TTRouteResult *)result {
       for(TTFullRoute *fullRoute in result.routes) {
           TTMapRoute *mapRoute = [TTMapRoute routeWithCoordinatesData:fullRoute
                                              withRouteStyle:TTMapRouteStyle.defaultActiveStyle
                                              imageStart:TTMapRoute.defaultImageDeparture
                                              imageEnd:TTMapRoute.defaultImageDestination]
           [self.mapView.routeManager addRoute:mapRoute];
           [self.mapView.routeManager showAllRoutesOverview];
       }}
   ```

   The above method provides a `TTRouteResult` object containing `TTFullRoute` objects. It then
   loops through the `TTFullRoute` collection. For each `TTFullRoute` object, it creates a
   new `TTMapRoute` instance and adds it to the `MapView.`

## Summary

Using this tutorial, you should have converted an iOS application from using Google Maps APIs to
Example's. Now you have a map with fresh and accurate traffic information, on which you can easily
plan many kinds of route. Not bad!<br />
