title: Route display
---

You can display a route on the map and customize its origin and destination icons. It is also
possible to specify the fill color, outline color, and width of the route.

**Sample use case:** When you add the route, you would like to highlight the starting and the
destination points. Also, you would like to plan several routes simultaneously with different origin
and destination points and use different icons.

Prerequisites:

The `NewMap NewMap` object was created and configured. Route coordinates are prepared.

<a
  href="#"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0', padding: '0' }}
  name="_origin_and_destination_icons_customization"
></a>

## Origin and destination icons customization

If you need to customize start and destination icons, you should create icons through the `Icon`
class.

The icon can be created in following ways:

- with a constructor:
  ```java
  Icon startIcon = new Icon(name, drawable)
  ```
- with the `Icon.Factory.fromDrawable` method:

  ```java
  Icon startIcon = Icon.Factory.fromDrawable(name, drawable);
  ```

  where `name` is a `String` object and `drawable` is a `Drawable` object.

- with the `Icon.Factory.fromResources` method:

  ```java
  Icon endIcon = Icon.Factory.fromResources(context, iconId);
  ```

  where `context` is your `Context` object and `iconId` is an icon resource identifier.

When icons are created, you can add them to the route using the `startIcon` and `endIcon` methods of
the `RouteBuilder` class,

<a
  href="#"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0', padding: '0' }}
  name="_route_customization"
></a>

## Route customization

You can create a route with custom style properties like fill color, outline color, and width.
First, you need to create the `RouteStyle` object:

<Code>

```java
RouteStyleBuilder.create()
        .withWidth(2.0)
        .withFillColor(Color.BLACK)
        .withOutlineColor(Color.RED)
        .build();
```

```kotlin
RouteStyleBuilder.create()
    .withWidth(ROUTE_WIDTH)
    .withFillColor(Color.BLACK)
    .withOutlineColor(Color.RED)
    .build()
```

</Code>

Next, you need to pass `routeBuilder` to the `addRoute` method of `NewMap`:

<Code>

```java
RouteBuilder routeBuilder = new RouteBuilder(route.getCoordinates())
        .endIcon(endIcon)
        .startIcon(startIcon)
        .style(routeStyle);
final Route mapRoute = NewMap.addRoute(routeBuilder);
```

```kotlin
val routeBuilder = RouteBuilder(route.getCoordinates())
    .style(RouteStyle.DEFAULT_ROUTE_STYLE)
    .startIcon(createIcon(R.drawable.ic_map_route_departure))
    .endIcon(createIcon(R.drawable.ic_map_route_destination))
    .tag(routeIdx.toString())
NewMap.addRoute(routeBuilder)
```

</Code>

If you don’t call `startIcon` and `endIcon` there will be no icons on route. You can specify only a
start icon by calling only `startIcon` or only an end icon by calling only `endIcon`.

If you don’t call `style` then the default style will be applied.

You can use different images and styles for different routes.
