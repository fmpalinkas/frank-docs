Some parts of Example data are subject to additional legal terms and conditions. When used, the customer must agree to and follow these additional conditions. Also, for some regions our APIs can have differences in requests and responses compared to the default API behavior. Customers should be aware of these differences before using the region-specific content.

## Region-specific API changes

### Response data for South Korea

South Korea switched from a land lot-based addressing format to a street name-based format in 2011. The old format is still widely used and therefore supported by the Search API, which means both address formats can be found and returned by various Search APIs (geocode, search, and reverse geocode).

Changes to the API response only apply to results of type `Point Address`. The Search API supports `Point Address` results with

1. only a street name-based address
2. both a street name-based address and a land lot-based address

### Street name-based address only

For a `Point Address` with only a street name-based address, the API response is identical to the default API response.

### Both address formats

Most street name-based addresses have a matching land lot-based address linked to it. To support this dual-addressing scheme, the API response contains the `address` field, as well as an additional field `linkedAddress`. The `address` field contains the street name-based address, while the region-specific `linkedAddress` field contains the land lot-based address.
The `linkedAddress` response object mostly follows the default `address` object, except for the addition of the following two fields.

An `Point Address` element in the `results` array with both address formats present is represented in JSON as follows:

```json [title=Response structure - JSON]
{
  "summary": {
    "query": "2501 soquel dr santa cruz ca 95065",
    "queryType": "NON_NEAR",

```
