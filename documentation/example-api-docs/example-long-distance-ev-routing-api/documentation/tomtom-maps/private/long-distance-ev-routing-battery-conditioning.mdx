This feature is still in development
and only available as a **Private Preview** for testing purposes. Go to the
[Private Preview](https://developer.Example.com/private-preview) page to see what
this means.

## Purpose

This document describes the **interface** of an extension to the normal
[Long Distance EV Routing](/long-distance-ev-routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/long-distance-ev-routing)
that enables the computation of LDEV routes that consider the energy for battery conditioning when estimating consumption.

Battery conditioning is the process of heating or cooling the battery. 
This is needed for safety and preserving battery life,
but also to improve performance and charging speed.
Battery conditioning costs energy. With this extension, the energy consumption 
can be taken into account during planning, which can increase the accuracy of the consumption prediction.

Currently only battery preconditioning is supported, which is conditioning before charging to improve charging speed.

If these additional parameters are not specified, it is assumed that no energy is needed for battery conditioning.

    ]
  },
  [...]
}
```

### POST request body parameters

The POST data can contain an optional `batteryConditioning` object that specifies the energy consumption for battery conditioning.
The `batteryConditioning` object contains two arrays of `preconditioningEfforts` and `preconditioningEffortsNextChargingStop`,
with `preconditioningEffortsNextChargingStop` being optional.

**Note**: Battery conditioning requires a charging model to be specified, which must be provided by the `ChargingParameters` object.
It is incompatible with the time-based `ChargingModes` model.
Please refer to the [Long Distance EV Routing POST data parameters](/long-distance-ev-routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/long-distance-ev-routing#post-request-body-parameters) for further information on the charging parameters.

      <td>
        Required. A list of `preconditioningEffort` objects that form a curve describing the energy consumption and time
        needed for battery preconditioning at each charging stop, depending on the charging power.
        Entries must be in strictly ascending order of `chargingPowerInkW`.
        Additionally, both `energyInkWh` and `timeInSeconds` must be in ascending order throughout the list of preconditioning efforts.
        An entry with `energyInkWh` set to 0 is permitted only once and must be the first entry in the list.
        If `energyInkWh` is 0, the corresponding `timeInSeconds` must also be 0, and vice versa.
        The relevant battery preconditioning effort for a given charging power is determined as follows:
        * For charging powers below the first entry, it is assumed that no effort is needed for battery preconditioning.
        * For a charging power that exactly matches an entry's `chargingPowerInkW`, the corresponding effort is used.
        * For charging powers between two entries, the efforts are interpolated linearly.
        * For charging powers above the last entry, the last entry's effort is used.
        The number of entries must be between 1 and 10.
        Note: This behavior is similar to how the `constantSpeedConsumptionInkWhPerHundredkm` curve is interpreted, but with the difference that for consumption curves,
        values for speeds outside the range are extrapolated using the nearest two entries.

        Optional. A list of `preconditioningEffort` objects that describe the energy consumption and time needed for battery preconditioning only at the next charging stop,
        that is, the first one after the specified route origin (independent of whether the route origin is the departure or an intermediate point of a longer trip).
        The preconditioning energy for the next charging stop can be different from that for further charging stations because it depends on the current battery temperature.
        The constraints are the same as those for `preconditioningEfforts`.
        If this is not specified, the next station is not treated specially, that is, its preconditioning effort is taken from the `preconditioningEfforts` list.

        Required. The charging power of the charging stop, in kW, for which this entry is valid.

        The charging power of a charging stop for battery preconditioning is determined by taking the minimum of the charging station's connector maximum power and the vehicle's [`chargingConnector.maxPowerInkW`](/long-distance-ev-routing-api/documentation/Example-maps/long-distance-ev-routing#post-request-body-parameters),
        while ignoring the limiting effects of `chargingConnector.efficiency` and `chargingConnector.baseLoadInkW`.
        The charging curve is not considered.

## Response data

All consumption estimates (e.g., `routes[].summary.batteryConsumptionInkWh`) are adjusted to account
for the energy needed for battery preconditioning.
As a current limitation, when there is not enough time for preconditioning (i.e., the time since departure,
the preceding charging stop or waypoint is less than `timeInSeconds`), we still assume the complete energy for preconditioning is used.
The preconditioning energy will be evenly distributed over the progress points (`progress[].batteryConsumptionInkWh`) based on the minimum
of `timeInSeconds` and `travelTimeInSeconds` of the leg.

Additionally, whenever the `batteryConditioning` parameter is specified in the request, the response contains a
`batteryPreconditioning` object in the `summary` section of each leg with the time and energy needed
for battery preconditioning.
