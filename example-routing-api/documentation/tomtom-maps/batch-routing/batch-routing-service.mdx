## Purpose

Batch Routing works as a subset of the  [Routing API](../product-information/introduction)  suite. This service enables you to dispatch batches of  [Calculate Route](../calculate-route)  and  [Calculate Reachable Range](../calculate-reachable-range)  requests with ease.

### Synchronous and Asynchronous batch processing

You can call Batch Routing APIs to run either synchronously or asynchronously.

## Synchronous API overview

The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight routing requests with quickly-expiring results (e.g., due to changing traffic conditions).

- In such a case, when the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the routes of the batch are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later on.
- The Synchronous API will return a timeout error if the request takes longer than 60 seconds.
- The number of batch items is limited to 100 for this API.

### Sequence of Synchronous API client actions

1. A client sends a request to the  [Synchronous Batch](../batch-routing/synchronous-batch)  endpoint.
2. The server will respond with one of the following:
  - An HTTP `200` Batch processing result: The calculation is finished before timeout and the client downloads results straight away.
  - An HTTP `408` request timeout error: This occurs if the request takes longer than 60 seconds and cannot be finished in this timeframe.
  - **Another HTTP error:** See the  [Synchronous Batch response codes](../batch-routing/synchronous-batch#http-status-codes).

## Asynchronous API overview

The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests.

- It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
- The Asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
- The number of batch items is limited to  `700`  for this API.

### Data retention period notice

Please be aware that batches processed by an Asynchronous API are available for download for 14 days, after which a results download will return a HTTP `404` (Not Found) response.

### Sequence of Asynchronous API client actions

1. A client sends a request to the  [Asynchronous Batch Submission](../batch-routing/asynchronous-batch-submission)  endpoint.
2. The server will respond with one of the following:
  - HTTP `202` or HTTP `303`: This depends on the `redirectMode` parameter with the `Location` header, which points to the  [Asynchronous Batch Download](../batch-routing/asynchronous-batch-download)  endpoint.
  - **Another HTTP error:** See the  [Asynchronous Batch Submission HTTP status codes](../batch-routing/asynchronous-batch-submission#http-status-codes).
3. After getting an HTTP `202` or HTTP `303` response, the client should follow the redirect to the  [Asynchronous Batch Download](../batch-routing/asynchronous-batch-download)  endpoint which is a blocking long poll request.
4. When a client calls the  [Asynchronous Batch Download](../batch-routing/asynchronous-batch-download)  endpoint the possible scenarios are:
   - Batch response is calculated before timeout (by default this is 120 seconds it can be changed by using the `waitTimeSeconds` parameter).
     - The client receives HTTP `200`.
     - Batch response is ready and it gets streamed to the client.
   - Batch response is not ready before timeout.
     - The client receives HTTP `202`.
     - Batch request is accepted for processing.
     - The client downloads batch results from the URL specified by the `Location` header (see point 3).
