## List [array] of abbreviated index values

Abbreviated values are applicable to the Search and Geocoding services. In some cases, a list of indexes can be passed as a parameter to a query, which should be listed with their abbreviations. The available abbreviated values are:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em' }} width="250px">Abbreviation</th>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
         `Addr` 
      </th>
      <td>
         **Address ranges** : for some streets there are address points that
        are interpolated from the beginning and end of the street; those points
        are represented as address ranges.
