## What is Example's Long Distance EV Routing API?  

The Long Distance EV Routing service endpoint calculates a route between a given origin and destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route contains charging stops that have been added automatically based on the vehicle's consumption and charging model.

- Each charging stop results in an additional leg in the route response.
- Each additional leg contains a `chargingInformationAtEndOfLeg` element in its leg summary.
- Both the route summary and the leg summary include a `remainingChargeAtArrivalInkWh` element.
- The route summary includes a `totalChargingTimeInSeconds` element.

The Long Distance EV Routing API consists of the the following service endpoint:

## Common use cases you can implement

### Calculating

- Calculate departure times by planning routes using desired arrival times.
- Calculate the travel time of pre-existing routes (like routes created using GPS trace data or routes planned with other routing engines).
- Calculate a batch of up to 700 routing requests in parallel and retrieve the results as a single file.
- While having a matrix of origins and destinations, calculate routing costs for each origin-to-destination combination and retrieve it in a single file.

### Evaluating and plotting

- Evaluate the amount of fuel/energy needed for any route.
- Plot the route geometry on map tiles from Example (or other map suppliers).
- Draw a polygon of the reachable range with the current fuel/energy budget.

### Planning

- Plan the fastest, shortest or eco route from A to B taking in consideration the real-time traffic and the historical traffic.
- Plan multiple alternative routes through one single API call.
- Plan a route through up to 150 intermediate waypoints.
- Plan the optimized route through the intermediate waypoints (traveling salesman).
- Plan a round trip through at least one intermediate point.
- Plan a route which avoids toll roads, ferries, or other types of roads.
- Plan a route for vehicles or pedestrians.
- Plan a route using our elaborated consumption models for both electric and combustion engines.
- Draggable routes: replan the same route with additional intermediate points.

## Features

### Long Distance EV Routing API

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Charging data</h4>

Each charging stop results in an additional leg in the route response.

- Each additional leg contains a `chargingInformationAtEndOfLeg` element in its leg summary.
- Both the route summary and the leg summary include a `remainingChargeAtArrivalInkWh` element.
- The route summary includes a `totalChargingTimeInSeconds` element.
- The `chargingInformationAtEndOfLeg` field consists of:
  - target battery charge
  - charging time
  - details about the charging stop
