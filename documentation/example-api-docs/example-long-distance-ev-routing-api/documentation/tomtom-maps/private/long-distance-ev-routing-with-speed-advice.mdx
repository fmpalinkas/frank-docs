## Private Preview Notice

<Blockquote type="announcement" hasIcon>

The Long Distance EV Routing service with Speed Advice is still in development
and only available as a **Private Preview** for testing purposes. Go to the
[Private Preview](https://developer.Example.com/private-preview) page to see what
this means.

</Blockquote>

## Purpose

Long Distance EV Routing estimates the speed of the driver along the planned
route based on historical and real-time traffic information. Clients might be
interested in the effect of higher or lower speeds on consumption and travel
time, in particular to see for which speeds a destination or charge stop is
still reachable, so that a speed advice can be provided to the driver.

For this, the
[Long Distance EV Routing](routing-api/documentation/extended-routing/long-distance-ev-routing)
service has an additional request parameter, `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh`, that
specifies a list of speed values. For each specified speed, the primary route
is augmented with alternative per-leg travel time and consumption information,
where the speed originally assumed in route planning is adapted according to
the provided value.

This feature can be used to advise a speed selected from the set of potential
candidates provided as `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh`, based on the projected
consumption, indicating that the next charging stop or the destination would be
reachable when traveling at the advised speed where possible.

## Request data

### HTTPS method: `POST`

Please refer to the generic
[request format](/routing-api/documentation/extended-routing/long-distance-ev-routing#request-data)
of the Long Distance EV Routing service.

#### curl command request example

```shell [type=post] [title=curl command request example]
curl -X POST 'https://api.Example.com/routing/1/calculateLongDistanceEVRoute/{routePlanningLocations}/json?key={Your_API_Key}&...'
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{
          [...]
          "speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh": [120, 110, 100, 95, 90]
        }'
```

### POST request parameters

In addition to the parameters outlined in the
[Calculate Route POST data parameters](/routing-api/documentation/routing/calculate-route#post-data-parameters)
and the
[Long Distance EV Routing POST data parameters](/routing-api/documentation/extended-routing/long-distance-ev-routing#request-data)
sections, the POST data can contain `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh` as a JSON array.

<table style={{ overflowWrap: 'anywhere' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold', width: '250px' }}>Parameter</th>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh`<br />
        *array of integers*
      </th>
      <td>
        A list of speeds in kilometers/hour in the range [90, 250].
        Each value is used to recalculate travel time and consumption on
        the primary route. The speed originally estimated in route planning is
        modified on appropriate parts of the route; the given value is treated
        as the driver's preferred speed. The route itself is not changed.<br />
        Based on the output, clients can advise one of the speeds as a succinct
        proposal to the driver, indicating that the next charging stop or the
        destination would be reachable when traveling at the advised speed
        where possible.<br />
        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>
           The list must not be empty and is restricted to a maximum of eight items.
          </li>
          <li>
            The additional output generated for `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh` is
            provided only for the primary route, not for potential alternative
            routes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the primary route contains a charging stop, no output is
            generated for legs beyond the first charging stop. This
            limitation might be changed in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even where the assumed speed on a road is modified, the new speed can
            be different from the specified value. The algorithm aims at avoiding
            overly optimistic consumption values or travel times.
          </li>
          <li>
            The calculation of travel times and consumption is a best-effort
            attempt to reflect the specified speeds and the results may be
            counter-intuitive in some cases. Due to differences in the
            calculation of the travel time and the consumption, inconsistencies
            can arise between these properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            In exceptional cases, the route path may become illegal to drive,
            for example, due to time-dependent restrictions. Also, a charging
            station along the route might be closed due to changed arrival
            times resulting from the provided speeds. Conditions such as these are
            currently not detected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parameters from
            [`reassessmentParameterSets`](/routing-api/documentation/routing/calculate-route#post-data-parameters)
            are not considered for speed advice.

### Response fields

A successful request when providing `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh` to the Long
Distance EV Routing service extends the fields specified in the
[Response data section](routing-api/documentation/extended-routing/long-distance-ev-routing#response-fields)
of the Long Distance EV Routing service as follows:

<table style={{ overflowWrap: 'anywhere' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2" style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Primary fields</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold', width: '250px' }}>Field</th>
      <th scope="col" style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        `speedAdviceRecords`<br />
        *array of speedAdviceRecord objects*
      </th>
      <td>
        This object holds the speed advice information generated for the
        `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh` and is, where applicable, inserted into the
        `summary` field of the individual legs of the route.<br />
        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The order of the entries in the array corresponds to the order of
            the speeds provided as `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh` in the request.
          </li>
          <li>
            The number of items in `speedAdviceRecords` can be less than the
            number of speeds provided in the request parameter
            `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh`. This occurs when the service detects that
            a specific speed would make the route illegal or unfeasible. In the
            special case that all speeds are deemed unsuitable, the field
            `speedAdviceRecords` may be omitted in the output.
          </li>

        *integer*
      </th>
      <td>
        The specific speed used to evaluate the travel time and consumption
        information. It corresponds to one of the speeds specified in the
        request parameter `speedAdviceSpeedsInKmh`.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <th>
        `travelTimeInSeconds`<br />
