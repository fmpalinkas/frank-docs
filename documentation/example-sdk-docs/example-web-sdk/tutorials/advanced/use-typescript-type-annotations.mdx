title: Use of TypeScript type annotations
---

## Overview of the tutorial

This tutorial covers how to start using the Example Maps SDK for Web with TypeScript type
annotations.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **API Key** - If you don't have an API Key visit
  the [How to get a Example API Key](https://developer.Example.com/how-to-get-Example-api-key) site and
  create one.

## What are typings?

Typings are used to describe the format and structure of objects. With typings available, the
compiler is able to investigate code and early discover errors like calling methods that don't exist
on an object, or passing arguments of the wrong type.

## Basic setup - JavaScript and downloadable package

This section covers the basic usage of type annotations in a JavaScript project with the Example Maps
SDK for Web downloadable zip package.

### Prerequisites

- **Example Maps SDK for Web**
  First, you need to download the **Maps library** from
  the [downloads page.](/maps-sdk-web-js/overview/product-information/downloads#npm-cdn-links-zip-packages)
- **TypeScript**
  Then all you have to do is install the TypeScript via npm:
  ```shell
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

Note that npm comes bundled with Node.js, so please make sure you have it installed on your machine.

### Creating a project

Now we can create an empty project. Let's call it **maps-with-typings-basic**.

```shell
mkdir maps-with-typings-basic
cd maps-with-typings-basic
```

With the empty project created, extract the dist directory from the **Maps library** zip package
as **web-sdk-maps** and put it in the project root directory.

### Setup

Now we need to create a `tsconfig.json` file to make use of the typings.

The best way to do that is to use the `tsc` command that comes with the TypeScript package.

```shell
tsc --init
```

It will generate a tsconfig.json file with some default settings and an extensive list of possible
commented-out options.

By default TypeScript will only check the .ts files, and since we are using it only as a type
checker we need to uncomment the following options in the `tsconfig.json` file:

- `"allowJs": true, /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */`
- `"checkJs": true, /* Report errors in .js files. */`
- `"noEmit": true, /* Do not emit outputs. */`

### Code

Let's create an `app.js` file where we will store our JavaScript code and `index.html` where we
reference it along with the Example Maps SDK for Web.

Now copy this content into the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="use-all-space">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Map</title>
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./web-sdk-maps/maps.css" />
    <style>
      #map {
        width: 100vw
        height: 100vh;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="map" class="map"></div>
    <script src="./web-sdk-maps/maps-web.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To enable type checking for the Example Maps SDK for Web we have to reference the index.d.ts from the
web-sdk-maps directory.

In order to do that, the first line of the app.js file must be in the following format:

```typescript
/// <reference path="web-sdk-maps/index.d.ts" />
```

Now type checking is enabled and should be picked up by your IDE. If it's not please check if you
have the proper extensions installed.

## Advanced setup - JavaScript and Webpack + NPM

This section covers the more advanced use of type annotations where JavaScript, Webpack, and NPM are
used.

### Creating a project

Create an empty project. Let's call it **maps-with-typings-js**

```shell
mkdir maps-with-typings-js
cd maps-with-typings-js
npm init -y
```

With the project initialized we can install the dependencies. First, we need to install the
TypeScript package along with the Webpack as development dependencies.

```shell
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server css-loader style-loader
```

Then we can install the Example Maps SDK for Web:

```shell
npm install @Example-international/web-sdk-maps@next
```

### Setup

First, we need to create a `tsconfig.json` file. Use the `tsc` command to do this:

```shell
tsc --init
```

After that we can create the Webpack configuration file `webpack.config.js` with the following
content:

```javascript
var path = require("path")
module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, "/app.js"),
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: __dirname,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: "ts-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
  },
}
```

Now let's add 'start' entry in scripts in the package.json file in order to run code:

```json
// ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development"
    },
// ...
```

### Code

We need to create 3 files to get this app running.

- **index.html** with the following content:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html class="use-all-space">
    <head>
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <title>My Map</title>
      <meta
        name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"
      />
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./web-sdk-maps/maps.css" />
      <style>
        #map {
          width: 100vw;
          height: 100vh;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="map" class="map"></div>
      <script src="./bundle.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
- **style.css** where we will import the Example Maps SDK for Web CSS style.
  ```css
  @import "@Example-international/web-sdk-maps";
  ```
- **app.js** is our main JavaScript file that will be bundled into the bundle.js file
  ```javascript
  require("./style.css")
  var tt = require("@Example-international/web-sdk-maps")

  var map = tt.map({
    key: "<your-Example-API-Key>",
    container: "map",
  })
  ```

Now we can start our app by running `npm start`. Typings will be checked and errors will be
displayed in the console and in the IDE.

## Advanced setup - TypeScript and Webpack + NPM

This section covers the more advanced use of type annotations where TypeScript, Webpack, and NPM are
used.

### Creating a project

Create an empty project. Let's call it **maps-with-typings**.

```shell
mkdir maps-with-typings
cd maps-with-typings
npm init -y
```

With the project initialized we can install the dependencies. First, we need to install the
TypeScript package along with the Webpack as development dependencies.

```shell
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server css-loader style-loader
```

Then we can install the Example Maps SDK for Web:

```shell
npm install @Example-international/web-sdk-maps@next
```

### Setup

In the first place, we need to create a `tsconfig.json` file. The best way to do that is by using
the `tsc` command:

```shell
tsc --init
```

After that we can create the Webpack configuration file `webpack.config.js` with the following
content:

```javascript
const path = require("path")
module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, "/app.ts"),
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: __dirname,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        loader: "ts-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
  },
}
```

Now let's add 'start' entry in scripts in the package.json file in order to run code:

```json
// ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development"
    },
// ...
```

### Code

We need to create 3 files to get this app running.

- **index.html** with the following content:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html class="use-all-space">
    <head>
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <title>My Map</title>
      <meta
        name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"
      />
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./web-sdk-maps/maps.css" />
      <style>
        #map {
          width: 100vw;
          height: 100vh;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="map" class="map"></div>
      <script src="./app.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
- **style.css** where we will import the Example Maps SDK for Web CSS style.
  ```css
  @import "@Example-international/web-sdk-maps";
  ```
- **app.ts** our main TypeScript file that will be compiled into the app.js file
  ```typescript
  import tt from "@Example-international/web-sdk-maps"
  import "./style.css"

  const map = tt.map({
    key: "<your-Example-API-Key>",
    container: "map",
  })
  ```

Now we can start our app by running `npm start`.

## Usage - IDE and console

Let's put that code in our app.js / app.ts file and see what happens:

```javascript
tt.map({
  key: "<your-Example-API-Key>",
  container: "map",
  zoom: "eight",
})
```

As you can see, type checking is now working and detected that the 'zoom' property should be a
number:

![IDE typings error](https://developer.Example.com/sites/default/files/ide-typing-error.png)

Alternatively, you can run the `tsc` command from the console.

```shell
~$  tsc
main.js:6:5 - error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number | undefined'.
6     zoom: 'eight'
    ~~~~
node_modules/@Example-international/web-sdk-maps/dist/index.d.ts:1514:9
    1514         zoom?: number,
                ~~~~
    The expected type comes from property 'zoom' which is declared here on type 'MapOptions'
Found 1 error.
```

With TypeScript support you will also get the context-aware code completion feature:
