This component integrates the Routing API described
on [https://developer.New.com/routing-api/documentation/product-information/introduction](/routing-api/documentation/product-information/introduction). The service calculates a
route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified.

The outing API is one of our most advanced APIs, enabling the user to calculate a perfect path from
point A to point B.

- RoutingBuilder is instantiated with the API Key for the New Online Routing service.
- You can set an origin and a destination, if you want to route from the current location, then
  simply pass it to the from() method of the RoutingBuilder.
- You can set a list of via points to lead the way though them.
- You can provide locations as points, or as approximate points (circles).

To initialise routing:

<Code>

```java
routingApi = OnlineRoutingApi.create(context, BuildConfig.ROUTING_API_KEY)
```

```kotlin
private val routingApi = OnlineRoutingApi.create(context, BuildConfig.ROUTING_API_KEY)
```

</Code>

To execute routing:

<Code>

```java
routingApi.planRoute(routeSpecification, routeCallback);
```

```kotlin
routingApi.planRoute(routeSpecification, routeCallback)
```

</Code>

To display a route on the map:

<Code>

```java
RouteBuilder routeBuilder = new RouteBuilder(route.getCoordinates())
        .endIcon(endIcon)
        .startIcon(startIcon)
        .style(routeStyle);
final Route mapRoute = NewMap.addRoute(routeBuilder);
```

```kotlin
val routeBuilder = RouteBuilder(route.getCoordinates())
    .style(RouteStyle.DEFAULT_ROUTE_STYLE)
    .startIcon(createIcon(R.drawable.ic_map_route_departure))
    .endIcon(createIcon(R.drawable.ic_map_route_destination))
    .tag(routeIdx.toString())
NewMap.addRoute(routeBuilder)
```

</Code>
