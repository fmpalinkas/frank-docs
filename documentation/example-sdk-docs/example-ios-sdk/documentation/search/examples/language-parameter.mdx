title: Language parameter
---

Develop an international app that can be used in different languages. Enhance the search
functionality with the language parameter so that the search returns results in a specific language.
Sample use case: If your mobile device is set to a particular language, you see it in your app as
well.

List of the supported languages can be found
at [Supported Languages](/search-api/documentation/product-information/supported-languages).

Use the following code snippet to try this in your app.

<Code>

```swift
let query = TTSearchQueryBuilder.create(withTerm: term)
    .withLang(language)
    .build()
search.search(with: query)
```

```objectivec
TTSearchQuery *query = [[[TTSearchQueryBuilder createWithTerm:term] withLang:language] build]
[self.search searchWithQuery:query];
```

</Code>
