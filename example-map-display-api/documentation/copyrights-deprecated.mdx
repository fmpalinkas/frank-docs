## Purpose

The Copyrights API is designed to serve copyright information for the Map Display services. In addition to basic copyright for the whole map, this API is serving specific groups of copyrights for some countries which are written in JSON, JSONP, or XML formats.

### Run this endpoint

You can easily run this and other endpoints. Go to the Example  [API Explorer](/map-display-api/api-explorer/)  page and follow the directions.

## Request data

The user may request copyright information for three contexts: for a **specific tile**, for a **stated bounding box**, or for **the whole world**.

### Tile

To obtain the copyright information for a particular tile, the Request should specify the tile's zoom level and x and y coordinates. See the  [Zoom Levels and Tile Grid](/map-display-api/documentation/zoom-levels-and-tile-grid)  page.

### Bounding box

Bounding box requests should specify the minimum and maximum `longitude` and `latitude` ([EPSG-3857](https://epsg.io/3857)) coordinates.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Whole world</h4>

To obtain the default copyright information for the whole world, **do not** specify a tile or bounding box.

### Schema

The generic copyrights call schemas are as follows.

- Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets &#123; &#125; **must be replaced** with their values.
- Please see the following [Request parameters](#request-parameters) section with the required and optional parameters tables for their values. The generic request format is as follows.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Whole world</h4>

In the following Whole world request, the `format` parameter is required.

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL]
https://{baseURL}/map/{versionNumber}/copyrights.{format}?key={Your_API_Key}
```

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Tile</h4>

In the following Tile request, the `zoom`, `X`, and `Y` parameters are required.

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL]
https://{baseURL}/map/{versionNumber}/copyrights/{zoom}/{X}/{Y}.{format}?key={Your_API_Key}
```

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Bounding box</h4>

In the following Bounding box request, the `minLon`, `minLat`, `maxLon`, and `maxLat` parameters are required.

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL]
https://{baseURL}/map/{versionNumber}/copyrights/{minLon}/{minLat}/{maxLon}/{maxLat}.{format}?key={Your_API_Key}
```

### HTTPS method: `GET`

- Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets &#123; &#125; **must be replaced** with their values.
- Please see the following [Request parameters](#request-parameters) section with the required and optional parameters tables for their values. The generic request format is as follows.

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>URL format</h4>

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL]
https://{baseURL}/map/{versionNumber}/copyrights/{minLon}/{minLat}/{maxLon}/{maxLat}.{format}?key={Your_API_Key}
```

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>curl command format</h4>

```shell [type=get] [title=Request curl command]
curl 'https://{baseURL}/map/{versionNumber}/copyrights/{minLon}/{minLat}/{maxLon}/{maxLat}.{format}?key={Your_API_Key}'
```

### Examples

To get the global copyrights in **JSON** format:

```shell [type=get] [title=Get global copyrights in JSON]
https://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights.json?key={Your_API_Key}
```

To get copyrights in **JSONP** format for Albuquerque in the United States, using tile coordinate parameters:

```shell [type=get] [title=Get copyrights in JSONP using tile coordinate parameters]
https://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/8/48/102.jsonp?key={Your_API_Key}
```

To get copyrights in **XML** format for Albuquerque in the United States, using bounding box parameters:

```shell [type=get] [title=Get copyrights in XML using bounding box parameters]
https://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/-106.8224/34.9246/-106.4008/35.3234.xml?key={Your_API_Key}
```

## Response data

For each request, the Copyrights API returns a file in JSON, JSONP or XML format that contains all copyrights for the specified area, ordered by country code (ISO3). The file contains the copyright applied to all countries (generalCopyrights) and any separate ones for the specific region requested. Where a map data provider provides copyright information in the form of an image file, it will be returned in base64 format for presentation as an embedded picture. The following is an example code embedding a base64 picture in the HTML page:

```html [title=Response body - HTML]
<html>
  <body>
    <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEA3ADcAAD/(...)//Z" />
  </body>
</html>

### Country names and images request

Optionally, you can get a response with only a list of countries and images without their copyright text. To achieve this, the `text=no` parameter has to be added to the request. To get copyrights with only country names and images in JSONP format for Albuquerque in United States, using tile coordinate parameters:

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL]
http://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/8/48/102.jsonp?text=no&key={Your_API_Key}
```

<h4 style={{ fontSize: '1em' }}>Example JSON file</h4>

```json [type=get] [title=Example - JSON]
{
  "formatVersion": "0.0.1",
  "regions": [
    {
      "country": {
        "ISO3": "USA"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Captions request

As an alternative to copyrights for map request, you can receive copyrights for the **map service**.

To get captions in **XML**:

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL for captions in XML]
http://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/caption.xml?key={Your_API_Key}
```

To get captions in **JSON**:

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL for captions in JSON]
http://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/caption.json?key={Your_API_Key}
```

To get captions in **JSONP**:

```shell [type=get] [title=Request URL for captions in JSONP]
http://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/caption.jsonp?key={Your_API_Key}
```

### Responses

```xml [title=XML response]
<copyrightsCaptionResponse formatVersion="0.0.1" xmlns="http://api.Example.com/map/1/copyrights/caption">
  <copyrightsCaption>©Example</copyrightsCaption>
</copyrightsCaptionResponse>
```

```json [title=JSON response]
