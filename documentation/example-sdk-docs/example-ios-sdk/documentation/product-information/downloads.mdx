# Project set up

To develop your own application with the Maps SDK, you need to make sure that the prerequisites are
in place and that you have added the Maps SDK as a dependency to your project. Follow the steps
below and then you are ready to code! The Maps SDK for iOS is compatible with Swift and Objective-C.

## Get the prerequisites in place:

- XCode installed ([How to install XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)).
- Set up the application deployment target to 9.1 or higher.
- Install Cocoapods ([How to install Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)).

On the 1st of February, we relocated the Legacy SDK for iOS packages.
The iOS package will now be provided as a single compressed file. 
If you wish to continue using our legacy Map SDK, see the following location change details and update your development environment accordingly.

1. Download the compressed package and unzip it:
[https://repositories.Example.com/artifactory/maps-sdk-legacy-ios/legacy_lns_sdk_2.4.714.zip]
2. Then manually include the framework in your Xcode project: choose Project > Add to Project and select the framework directory. (Alternatively, you can control-click your project group and choose Add Files > Existing Frameworks from the contextual menu.)
3. After you add an existing framework to your project, Xcode will ask you to associate it with one or more targets in your project.
4. Once associated, Xcode automatically links the framework against the resulting executable.


## Choose SDK modules for your app

Either independently include modules for Maps, Search and/or Routing, or all of them at once. You
can do so by adding Maps SDK modules to Podfile and running pod install again:

- MAP - Getting started
- SEARCH - Getting started
- ROUTING - Getting started
- TRAFFIC - Getting started
- GEOFENCING - Getting started

## Configuration for all Maps SDK modules

To include all Maps SDK modules in your app.

- Add services keys taken from [http://developer.Example.com](http://developer.Example.com).
- Create Podfile

```ruby
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMaps'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKSearch'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKRouting'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKTraffic'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMapsUIExtensions'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMapsStaticImage'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKMapsDriving'
pod 'ExampleOnlineSDKGeofencing'
```

- Now go to the console and install the frameworks by typing **pod install**

## Maps SDK Examples app

The Maps SDK Examples app is available in two flavors: Swift and Objective-C. Download and build the
Maps SDK Examples app to see key features of the Maps SDK.

Modify the source code to learn more about the SDK.

Speed up development by using the source code in your own app.

## Building and Launching

To build your application, open a newly created by Cocoapods XCode workspace, not a project.
