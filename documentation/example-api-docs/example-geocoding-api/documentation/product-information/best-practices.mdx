## When to use the Geocoding API?

Use the Geocoding API when you want to resolve complete addresses (for example, “109 Park Row, New York, United States”). The Geocoding API can also geocode partial addresses and those with typos. The Geocoding API is not designed to interact with real users when the input is given letter-by-letter.

If you want to resolve an address in the app in which input is provided by people usually letter-by-letter. Please use [Fuzzy Search](https://developer.Example.com/search-api/documentation/search-service/fuzzy-search).

The Geocoding API is built for automated systems processing complete, unambiguous postal addresses, or those that are incomplete, not well formatted, or with typos.

  Geocode is popular among following market segments: fleet, ride hailing, and
  food delivery.
</h4>

- **Fleet &amp; Logistics**: These companies are users of this service. Just send a list of fully-written addresses **to get all coordinates for route planning**.

- **Fleet &amp; Logistics, food delivery**: It can be very useful for **last mile, pick-up, drop-off, and delivery**.

- **Ride hailing**: for the **pick-up and drop-off of passengers**.

- **Data analysis**:
  - Data from the Geocoding API can be used in **spatial analysis** when results are derived by computer processing.
  - It can be used for **address verification** to detect fraud.

- **Data transformation**: Geocoding is an important component of data transformation because it can improve the data quality of a company's address database by **cleaning and enhancing data**.

- **User applications**: Geocode can be also useful in **user applications**. For example, when trying to resolve address issues **that are not human-to-machine interactions and the query contains a full address**.

## How to use request parameters to get better results?

The following topics provide some helpful tips to improve your Geocoding API query results.

**Note:** Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets `{ }` must be replaced with their values.

## Using geo-biasing with a lat/lon pair

In order to geo-bias your results to the relevant area for your user, you should always use a `lat/lon` pair to help bias the results to the user's location. Note, this is a non-restrictive bias, but for very common searches it will find the instances nearby. This query will find places around the `lat/lon`:

```markdown [title=Lat/lon pair]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/geocode/De Ruijterkade 154, 1011 AC, Amsterdam.json?lat=52.3773&lon=4.9084&key={Your_API_Key}
```

## Using radius

If geo-biasing is not strong enough for keeping your results local to the user, you can also pass in a `radius` (in meters) to restrict the result to a given area. For instance, this query will only find an item within 1000 meters of the given `lat/lon`:

```markdown [title=Radius]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/geocode/De Ruijterkade 154, 1011 AC, Amsterdam.json?lat=52.3773&lon=4.9084&radius=1000&key={Your_API_Key}
```

## Using idxSet

You can also specify the exact set of indexes to query in the `idxSet` parameter. For instance if you are only interested:

```markdown [title=idxSet]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/geocode/De Ruijterkade 154, 1011 AC, Amsterdam.json?lat=52.3773&lon=4.9084&idxSet=PAD,Str,Xstr,Geo,Addr&key={Your_API_Key}
```

The idxSet parameter value set of indexes that can be used are:

- `PAD` = Point Addresses
- `Str` = Streets
- `Geo` = Geographies
- `Xstr` = Cross Streets (intersections)
- `Addr` = Address range interpolation (when there is no PAD)

**Note:** If you are using more than one index, do not include any spaces between them in the comma-separated string.

## Using a subset of countries

You can also specify a subset of the countries on the server by adding a comma-separated list of countries in the form:

```markdown [title=Subset of countries]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/geocode/De Ruijterkade 154, 1011 AC, Amsterdam.json?&countrySet=NL&key={Your_API_Key}
```

See the Example [Geocoding API Market Coverage](./market-coverage) page for a list of all the countries supported by the Geocoding API engine.

## Understanding a response

The following example uses JSON. Note: For your benefit, the code comments are preceded by // and are not part of the actual JSON.

```json [title=JSON Response]
