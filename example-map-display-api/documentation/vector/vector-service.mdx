### Tile

Example's global digital map content comprises a large volume of data, and to efficiently transmit map images for display over the internet simultaneously to multiple users. The data are divided into grid sections called **tiles**.

- The tiles are rendered at various sizes and available at 23 different zoom levels, ranging from `0` to `22`.
- For zoom level `0`, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level `22`, the world is divided into 2<sup>44</sup> tiles.
- The format of the tile is formally described using the  [protobuf schema](/map-display-api/documentation/vector/content#schema-data).
- The content and the meaning of each tile layer is described in the  [tile layers description](/map-display-api/documentation/vector/content#tile-layers).
