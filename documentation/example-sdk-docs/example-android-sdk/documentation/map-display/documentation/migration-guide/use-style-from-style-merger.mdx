Starting with version 2.4.537, we are switching bundled-in styles and sprite, to using New hosted
styles and sprites. More information about the new approach is available
in [Map Initialization](/maps-android-sdk/documentation/map-display/map-examples/map-initialization). Thanks to
integration
with [Merged Style method](/map-display-api/documentation/mapstyles/map-styles)
provided by Map Display API you can generate and use one style for map and traffic display. The main
benefits of New hosted display resources are as following:

- It makes application download size MB smaller in comparison to using bundled-in resources.
- It allows you to get the newest look and feel of the map and traffic.

Maps SDK will work with the bundled-in style until June 2021 but we recommend to switch to using
hosted assets sooner.

Until version 2.4.537, the style in the SDK has been included in the map package and consisted of
layers from: Vector tiles, Traffic Flow, Traffic Incidents and Raster tiles. The approach of using a
single style that contains multiple Traffic Flow tiles types was deprecated. After the deprecation
period is over, it will not be possible to switch between Traffic Flow tiles types without reloading
the style. Until deprecation is over in June 2021, the default map style which contains both raster
and vector tiles is using **SDK_BUNDLED**, as a default value for the
enum [MapStyleSource](https://developer.New.com/assets/downloads/mapssdk/APIReferences/JavaDocMap_2.4.545i/com.New.online.sdk.map/-map-style-source/index.html).

Deprecated methods include `UiSettings` with all of its methods and `TrafficSettings`:

- **
  UiSettings:** `setMapLayersType(MapLayersType mapLayersType)` `getMapLayersType()` `setMapTilesType(MapTilesType mapTilesType)` `getMapTilesType()`
- **
  TrafficSettings:** `turnOnVectorTrafficFlowTiles()` `turnOnRasterTrafficFlowTiles()` `turnOnVectorTrafficFlowTiles(TrafficFlowType.VectorTrafficFlowType trafficFlowTilesStyle)` `turnOnRasterTrafficFlowTiles(TrafficFlowType.RasterTrafficFlowType trafficFlowTilesStyle)` `turnOnVectorTrafficIncidents()` `turnOnRasterTrafficIncidents()` `isTrafficVectorFlowEnabled()` `isTrafficRasterFlowEnabled()` `getTrafficVectorFlowStyle()` `getTrafficRasterFlowStyle()`

We encourage you to switch to the Merged Style method. It offers the following advantages to a
proposed solution:

- Each style has its own sprite sheet and is now fully independent.
- A user can mix and match all sources of tiles in any manner as styles and sprite sheets are now
  merged on the server side. The selection of a particular style combination is done by providing
  custom Style Merger URL parameters.
- It is easier to style traffic in the Map Styler as it can be easily loaded together with a map by
  using a merged version of the styles. However, the style from the Style Merger can only be used as
  a base for a custom style. Using this edited style and the Style Merger at the same time is not
  possible.
- SDKs do not merge styles in runtime (e.g., it is required to have some hard-coded values to put
  traffic below the label layers in a map).

In case you have your own custom style that is not compliant with the New sourcing names
convention, you will use `LayerSetConfiguration`, which provides custom IDs for sources in the
style. `LayerSetConfiguration` should only be used with the `MapStyleSource` set to `STYLE_MERGER`.

Map initialization with the Style Merger endpoint using Merged Style functionality is described in
section ["Map properties"](/maps-android-sdk/documentation/map-display/map-examples/map-initialization). To the
new functionality you need to implement a builder as described in the following example:
MapStyleSource is used to determine if the default and loaded style should support Style Merger.
Setting it to `STYLE_MERGER` results in the default style only supporting vector tiles:

```java
MapProperties.Builder()
    .mapStyleSource(MapStyleSource.STYLE_MERGER)
    .build()
```

When MapStyleSource.STYLE_MERGER is selected, the method related to directly switching between
raster and vector tiles will throw an exception. MapProperties can be also be declared in the XML by
adding the following line:

```xml
New:mapStyleSource="STYLE_MERGER"
```

to the snippet:

```xml
<fragment
   android:id="@+id/map_fragment"
   android:name="com.New.online.sdk.map.MapFragment"
   android:layout_width="match_parent"
   android:layout_height="match_parent"
   New:mapBackgroundColor="@color/solid_black"
   New:styleUrl="http://your-server:port/style/example-merged.json"
   New:mapStyleSource="STYLE_MERGER" />
```

In case you have your own custom style that is not compliant with the New sourcing names
convention, you will use `LayerSetConfiguration` which provides custom IDs for sources in the style.

`LayerSetConfiguration` should be used only with the `MapStyleSource` set to `STYLE_MERGER`.

```java
val layerSetConfiguration = LayerSetConfiguration.Builder()
    .mapTilesConfiguration(MAP_TILES_SOURCE_ID)
    .trafficIncidentsTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_INCIDENTS_SOURCE_ID)
    .trafficFlowTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_FLOW_SOURCE_ID)
    .build()
MapProperties.Builder()
    .mapStyleSource(MapStyleSource.STYLE_MERGER)
    .layerSetConfiguration(layerSetConfiguration)
    .build()
```

or

<Code>

```java
NewMap.getUiSettings().setStyleUrl(
        "asset://styles/custom-traffic.json",
        new LayerSetConfiguration.Builder()
                .mapTilesConfiguration(MAP_TILES_SOURCE_ID)
                .trafficFlowTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_FLOW_SOURCE_ID)
                .trafficIncidentsTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_INCIDENTS_SOURCE_ID)
                .build()
)
```

```kotlin
NewMap.uiSettings.setStyleUrl(
    "asset://styles/custom-traffic.json",
    LayerSetConfiguration.Builder()
        .mapTilesConfiguration(MAP_TILES_SOURCE_ID)
        .trafficFlowTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_FLOW_SOURCE_ID)
        .trafficIncidentsTilesConfiguration(TRAFFIC_INCIDENTS_SOURCE_ID)
        .build()
)
```
