MAP - com.New.online:sdk-maps

- \[FEATURE\] Hosted map and traffic display resources (styles and sprites)

Starting with version 2.4.537, we are switching bundled-in styles and sprite, to using New hosted
styles and sprites. More information about the new approach is available in Map Initialization.
Thanks to integration with Merged Style method provided by Map Display API you can generate and use
one style for map and traffic display. The main benefits of New hosted display resources are as
following: - It makes application download size​ MB smaller in comparison to using bundled-in
resources. - It allows you to get the newest look and feel of the map and traffic.Maps SDK will work
with the bundled-in style until June 2021 but we recommend to switch to using hosted assets sooner.
The information how to do that is available in the Migration Guide

- \[IMPROVEMENT\] Adjusted examples "Map tiles" and "Traffic layers" - presenting functionality of
  hosting resources
