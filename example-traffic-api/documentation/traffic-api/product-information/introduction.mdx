## What is TomTom's Traffic API?

The Traffic API is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic. These web services can be used via RESTful APIs.

The TomTom Traffic team offers a wide range of solutions to enable you to get the most out of your applications. Make use of the real-time traffic products or the historical traffic analytics to create applications and analysis that fits the needs of your end-users.

The offering is split into:

- **Traffic Incidents:** This provides an accurate view about _traffic jams_ and _incidents_ around a road network.
- **Traffic Flow:** This provides _real time observed speeds_ and _travel times_ for all key roads in a network.

The Traffic API web services are based on the real-time traffic data TomTom Traffic&trade.

The Traffic API consists of the the following services with endpoints:

## Getting started

1. To get your API Key, you first need to be registered for the TomTom Developer Portal. If you don't have an account, no worries!  [Register](https://developer.tomtom.com/member/register)  /  [Sign in](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/login)  now before continuing.
2. Once you are registered, go to your  [Dashboard](https://developer.tomtom.com/user/me/apps)  and locate the API Key that you would like to use (we've created the first one for you, it's called My first API Key).
3. Read the documentation and start coding.
4. Consider using the TomTom Maps SDK for  [Web](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js) , for  [iOS](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-ios) , and for  [Android](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-android).
5. Check related  [Blog articles](https://developer.tomtom.com/blog/tag/traffic)  for further information.

## Features

Harness the power of  [TomTom Traffic&trade;](https://developer.tomtom.com/blog/build-different/using-traffic-data-maps-and-routes)  for your application!

In both the Traffic Flow and Traffic Incident RESTful APIs, different road categories are displayed depending on the zoom level.

### TomTom&#39;s Traffic Incident RESTful API

- Is updated every minute with the very latest traffic incident and delay information.
- Returns detailed information about _traffic jams_ and _traffic related incidents_.
  - Details include: start-location, end-location, road-name, type of delay, length (in time) of the delay, significance, and distance.
- The **Raster and Vector Incident Tile APIs** provide traffic incident and delay information for display on your map view.

### TomTom&#39;s Traffic Flow RESTful API

- Is updated every minute with very latest traffic speed information.
- Returns detailed information about  *traffic speed*.
  - Details include: current speed, freeflow speed, and quality indicator.
- The **Raster and Vector Flow Tile APIs** provide traffic speed information for display on your map view.
- An option is provided to use the absolute or relative speed information.

## Common use cases you can implement

### Display

- Real-time traffic incident data on a map, or display real-time traffic segment speed data on a map.
- Traffic delay data with delay details like location, length, and delay.
- Segment details like free-flow speed, current speed, and confidence values.
- Obtain current traffic speed information with information about the real-time speed per road segment and display them on a TomTom map.

### Indicate

- The _severity of the current traffic condition_ with colored tubes indicating the delay severity.
- The _accurate location of slowdowns_ with colored tubes indicating the delay severity.

### Combine

The _Traffic Flow Speed information_ with other real-time traffic information for a Traffic Management Monitoring application.
