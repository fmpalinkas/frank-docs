## Purpose  

The following topics provide some helpful tips to improve your Search API query results.  

**Note:** Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets `{ }` must be replaced with their values.  

## Using geobias  

In order to geo-bias your results to the relevant area for your user, you should always use a `geobias` parameter to help bias the results to the user's location. Note, this is a non-restrictive bias, but for very common searches it will find the instances nearby. <br /><br />
This query will find places with pizza biased to the point `lat,lon`:  

```shell [title=point:lat,lon]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239

```

This query will find places with pizza biased to the rectangle `topLeftLat,topLeftLon,btmRightLat,btmRightLon`:  

```shell [title=rectangle:topLeftLat,topLeftLon,btmRightLat,btmRightLon]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=rectangle:37.8085,-122.4239,34.8085,-121.4239

```

## Using radius  

If geo-biasing is not strong enough for keeping your results local to the user, you can also pass in a `radius` (in meters) to restrict the result to a given area. For instance, this query will only find pizza within 1000 meters of the given point `lat/lon`:  

```shell [title=Radius]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239&radius=1000
```

## Using idxSet  

You can also specify the exact set of indexes to query in the `idxSet` parameter. For instance if you are only interested:  

```shell [title=idxSet]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239&idxSet=POI,PAD,Str,Xstr,Geo,Addr
```

The idxSet parameter value set of indexes that can be used are:  

- `POI` = Points of interest
- `PAD` = Point Addresses
- `Str` = Streets
- `Geo` = Geographies
- `Xstr` = Cross Streets (intersections)
- `Addr` = Address range interpolation (when there is no PAD)  

Note: If you are using more than one index, do not include any spaces between them in the comma-separated string.  

## Using a subset of countries  

You can also specify a subset of the countries on the server by adding a comma-separated list of countries in the form:  

```shell [title=Subset of countries]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&countrySet=HR,CY,CZ,DK
```

(search for pizza in Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, and Denmark)  
See the Example [Search API Market Coverage](./market-coverage) page for a list of all the countries supported by the Search API engine.

## Using different response formats  

We also support JSON or XML formatted responses.  

```shell [title=Request example with a JSON response format]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.json?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239
```

```shell [title=Request example with an XML response format]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/pizza.xml?key={Your_API_Key}&apiVersion=1&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239
```

## Using pure Category Search  

Finally, if you are interested in pure category search we have a special endpoint: [Category Search](../search-service/category-search). The following query will produce a category search for important tourist attractions:        

```shell [title=Category Search]
https://api.Example.com/maps/New/places/search/categorySearch/important tourist monument.json?key={Your_API_Key}&geobias=point:37.8085,-122.4239
```

## Understanding a response summary  

The following example uses JSON. Note: For your benefit, the code comments are preceded by // and are not part of the actual JSON.

```json [title=JSON Response]
{
  "summary": {
    "query": "Example",        // echo of the query
    "queryTime": 38,          // query time on server in milliseconds
    "numResults": 10,         // total number of result in this response
    "totalResults": 51,       // total number of hits within the entire database
                              // to find matches, e.g. 1 means more accurate and 4 means less
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "POI",  // responses type (see table of types above)
      "id": 50422,    // non-stable id for this document (might change in subsequent release)
      "score": 4,     // score of this document relative to other scores in same response
      "poi": {
        ...
```
