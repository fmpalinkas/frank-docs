Use various real-time traffic information in your application and create custom features based on
traffic incidents and/or traffic flow data to provide the best user experience in your client
application. Integrate the TRAFFIC module to get different traffic data from Traffic API Flow
Segment Data and Traffic API Incident Details. Combine the MAP module with the TRAFFIC module to
benefit from both the traffic flow and incidents visualization (MAP) and traffic data (TRAFFIC).
