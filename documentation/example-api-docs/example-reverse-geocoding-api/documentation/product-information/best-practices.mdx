## Purpose

The following topics provide some helpful tips to improve your Example API query results.

**Note:** Constants and parameters enclosed in curly brackets `{ }` must be replaced with their values.

## Using radius

You can use a radius parameter to restrict the result to a given area around input coordinates. Radius is defined in meters. For instance, this query will return a building result (Point Address type result) only if there is one in a 100 meter radius from the given lat/lon:

```shell [title=Request with a radius parameter and its value]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/reverseGeocode/52.157831,5.223776.json?key={Your_API_Key}&radius=100
```

If there are no buildings within the given radius, then the street match type result might be returned (if there are streets within the radius from the particular point) - as in the example given above. Depending on the use case (for example: for a delivery use-case) limiting radius might be extremely useful for filtering out unacceptable results. Of course, limiting radius decreases the amount of returned full addresses in general.

For other use-cases (like fleet tracking) a higher radius is usually advised. You may modify the example query by changing the accepted radius to 200m (or more) to see that in this case a full address will be returned (as there is a property 170 meters away from the input coordinates). Remember that a higher radius value means a lower general address precision is accepted. On the other hand, it increases the chance of obtaining a full address (including a house number).

## Using different response formats

We also support JSON or XML formatted responses.

```

```shell [title=Request example with an XML response format]
https://api.Example.com/search/2/reverseGeocode/52.157831,5.223776.xml?key={Your_API_Key}
```

## Setting a response language

Our service by default returns results using the language and alphabet used in a reverse geocoded location. For example,

- For input coordinates from Spain, the returned results will be using the Spanish language.
- For input coordinates from Greece, the results will be using the Greek language, and the Greek alphabet will be preferred.

If you want to restrict results to one specific language you will need to explicitly set it in the request parameters. For example, by setting the `language` parameter to a value of `en`, you explicitly request results in the English language (using the Latin alphabet) whenever possible.

## Understanding a response

The `returnMatchType` parameter can be used to get a response type explicitly returned in the response. This might be useful for understanding the quality of the match/returned result.

When this parameter is used then the response will have a `matchType` response field with one of the following returned values: `AddressPoint` / `HouseNumberRange` / `Street`.

- The `AddressPoint` value means that the exact address was found and returned.
- The `HouseNumberRange` value means that the address is approximated from the house number range assigned to `road-element`.
- The `Street` value means that returned result doesn't contain the full address data particularly that no building was matched and thus the `buildingNumber` (and `streetNumber`) fields will be missing in the response.
  - The `Street` match-level result means that the result cannot be used as an address. For example, for package or food delivery purposes.
  - It might be an indication of a gap in our data, but it can also be a 100% correct and accurate response, for example, input coordinates lying on the highway.

## Understanding a response summary

The following example uses JSON. Note: For your benefit, the code comments are preceded by // and are not part of the actual JSON.

```json [title=JSON response]
{
  "summary": {
    "queryTime": 9, // query time on the server in milliseconds
    "numResults": 1 // number of results in this response, always set to 1
  },
  "addresses": [
    // array that always contains one element
    {
      "address": {
        "buildingNumber": "3", // building number on the street, it is the same as streetNumber
        "streetNumber": "3", // building number on the street, it is the same as buildingNumber
        "routeNumbers": [], // this attribute returns official route numbers if there are any assigned, like I-80 for Interstate 80
        "street": "Vuurscheweg", // the street name, it is the same as streetName
        "streetName": "Vuurscheweg", // the street name, it is the same as street
        "streetNameAndNumber": "Vuurscheweg 3", // the street name and number concatenated
        "countryCode": "NL", // ISO 3166-1 alfa-2 country code
        "countrySubdivision": "Utrecht", // state or Province
        "municipality": "De Bilt", // a municipality, often a city/town name
        "postalCode": "3723", // postal code
        "municipalitySubdivision": "Bilthoven", // smaller organization unit than municipality, here a village
        "country": "Holandia", // country name
        "countryCodeISO3": "NLD", // ISO 3166-1 alfa-3 country code
        "freeformAddress": "Vuurscheweg 3, 3723 MD Bilthoven", // full formated address that can be used for addressing a place; freeformAddress is formed according to appropriate country addressing rules
        "boundingBox": {
          // boundingBox enclosing the closest road-element to input cooridnates
          "northEast": "52.158259,5.223712",
          "southWest": "52.158148,5.222734",
          "entity": "position"
        },
        "extendedPostalCode": "3723 MD", // extended postal code (available only is some places)
        "localName": "Bilthoven" // localName, most often is the same value as municipality or municipalitySubdivision, used in freeformAddress
      },
      "position": "52.159172,5.223768" // position of a matched result, in the case of a building itâ€™s entry point
    }
  ]
}
