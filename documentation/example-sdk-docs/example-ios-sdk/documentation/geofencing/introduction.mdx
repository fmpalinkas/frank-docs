**IMPORTANT:** The Example Geofencing API and Geofencing module in the Maps SDK for iOS are currently
in Public Preview. To find out what our Public Preview is and to revisit our Terms and Conditions,
see this [Public Preview Page](https://developer.Example.com/public-preview).

Add the capability to define virtual barriers on real geographic locations using the Geofencing
module. Together with the location of an object, you can determine whether that object is located
within or outside of a predefined geographic area.

Also see the [Geofencing API](/geofencing-api/documentation/product-information/introduction) documentation for
detailed information.
