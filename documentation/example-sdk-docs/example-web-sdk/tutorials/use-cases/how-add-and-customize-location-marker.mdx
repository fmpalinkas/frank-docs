title: How to add and customize a location marker
---

## Overview

In this tutorial you will learn how to add a Example map with a marker to your website.

- You can display your company location and show your clients where they can find you.
- You can add the address and image to the marker in order to make it more personalized.

## Prerequisites

To start using the Example Maps SDK for Web, you need the following:

- **API Key** - If you don't have an API key visit
  a [How to get a Example API key](https://developer.Example.com/how-to-get-Example-api-key) site and
  create one.
- **Coordinates**<br/>
  How to find your company location coordinates?<br/>
  The simplest way to obtain these coordinates is to go
  to [api_explorer](/search-api/api-explorer). First, click **Fuzzy
  Search** and then click the **Try it out** button. Let us assume your company address is: '100
  Century Center Ct 210, San Jose, CA 95112, USA'. You have to place it in a **query** field and
  clear other pre-populated fields. Then scroll down and press the **Execute** button. Please take
  into account that you should not use special HTML characters (like '\$','?',&','#') in the
  address. In the Response you can find the section and there you can see that the very first item
  from the list of items matched your query. Look at the property following the address fields.
  There you can see the data you need:
  ```xml
  <position>
  <lat>37.36729</lat>
  <lon>-121.91595</lon>
  </position>
  ```

## Displaying a map

The following minimal HTML structure contains the JavaScript code to initialize and display a Example
map:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My map</title>
    <!-- Replace version in the URL with desired library version -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="https://api.Example.com/maps-sdk-for-web/cdn/6.x/<version>/maps/maps.css"
    />
    <script src="https://api.Example.com/maps-sdk-for-web/cdn/6.x/<version>/maps/maps-web.min.js"></script>
    <style>
      #map {
        height: 500px
        width: 500px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="map"></div>
    <script>
      var map = tt.map({
        container: "map",
        key: "<your-api-key>",
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To run this example locally, create an _index.html_ file. Then you can copy the preceding HTML code
and paste it into the file you have just created. Replace `‘<your-api-key>‘` with the API Key you
obtained before (in the Prerequisites section).

Then run the _index.html_ file in your browser. Now you should see a map.

## Displaying the company on the map

Now, let us place your company on the map.\
Define a variable and set your company's coordinates (lon/lan) in an array:

```javascript
var speedyPizzaCoordinates = [-121.91595, 37.36729]
```

Now add coordinates to the map initialization to focus it on your company:

```javascript
var map = tt.map({
  container: "map",
  key: "<your-api-key>",
  center: speedyPizzaCoordinates,
  zoom: 15,
})
```

Create a marker variable and add it to the map:

```javascript
var marker = new tt.Marker().setLngLat(speedyPizzaCoordinates).addTo(map)
```

Define a pop-up connected with your marker. Additionally, make it open/visible to the user:

```javascript
var popupOffsets = {
  top: [0, 0],
  bottom: [0, -70],
  "bottom-right": [0, -70],
  "bottom-left": [0, -70],
  left: [25, -35],
  right: [-25, -35],
}

var popup = new tt.Popup({ offset: popupOffsets }).setHTML(
  "your company name, your company address"
)
marker.setPopup(popup).togglePopup()
```

You should see the map with your company name and address in the pop-up. To separate the first line
from the second line, use a &lt;br /&gt; tag. You can also bold your company name to make the whole
pop-up clearer:

```javascript
var popup = new tt.Popup({ offset: popupOffsets }).setHTML(
  "<b>Speedy's pizza</b><br/>100 Century Center Ct 210, San Jose, CA 95112, USA"
)
```

Now you have your company location on the map!

## Customization

Optionally, you can do some more customization to make it look better. So far, you used a default
marker. Let us assume that you want to have a custom marker icon on the map for a pizza restaurant.
First, create an _img_ folder in your project. Then, add the image you want to use as the marker to
this folder. Here you can find the custom marker used for this
tutorial: [pizza marker](https://github.com/Example-international/Example-use-case-company-location-web/tree/master/img). Now you can go back to _index.html_. Before you defined the marker in this way:

```javascript
var marker = new tt.Marker().setLngLat(speedyPizzaCoordinates).addTo(map)
```

Now, you need to create a div element and set the style. Indicate it in the marker options. Assuming
that your image is named 'pizza_marker.png', your new code will look like this:

```css
#marker {
  background-image: url("img/pizza_marker.png");
  background-size: cover;
  width: 50px;
  height: 70px;
}
```

```javascript
var element = document.createElement("div")
element.id = "marker"

var marker = new tt.Marker({ element: element })
  .setLngLat(speedyPizzaCoordinates)
  .addTo(map)
```

If you run your map now, you should see that your marker uses your image instead of the default one.
Depending on your image, you may want the icon placed centrally on the location, or you may want to
have it shifted so it will point at your company. The same applies to the pop-up. You may want to
move it up a bit if you do not want to cover your company logo. If you want to solve these issues
you should adjust the `anchor` and `offset` properties.

Now you need to add some content to your pop-up. Right now it looks like this:

```javascript
var popup = new tt.Popup({ offset: popupOffsets }).setHTML(
  "<b>Speedy's pizza</b><br/>100 Century Center Ct 210, San Jose, CA 95112, USA"
)
```

Let's start by adding an image to your pop-up so the customer can see your company's logo/photo. Add
the image you want to use to the _img_ folder which is located next to the _sdk_ folder (the same
way you previously did it with the marker image). Let us assume that you want to see in your pop-up:

- your company's name
- advertising text below it
- your company's address
- the image aligned to the right side

See the following code:

```javascript
var customPopup =
  '<p style="display:inline">' +
  '<img src="img/pizza_oven_illustration.png" alt="pizza oven" style="width:50%;float:right;padding-top:10px">' +
  '<div style="width:50%; height:100%; padding-top:10px"><span style="font:14px Gotham">Speedy&#39;s pizza</span></br>' +
  '<div style="font:9px Gotham"><span style="color:grey">In 30 minutes at your place!</span><div><br/>' +
  '<span style="font:10px Gotham">100 Century Center Ct 210, San Jose, CA 95112<br/>USA</span></br>' +
  "</div></p>"

var popup = new tt.Popup({ offset: popupOffsets }).setHTML(customPopup)
```

As you can see, you can put all HTML code and styling to the customPopup variable. Feel free to
change the code and experiment a bit until you achieve the appearance you like the most! Now you
need to add the map to your website.
