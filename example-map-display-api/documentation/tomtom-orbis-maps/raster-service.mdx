### Map Tile

TomTom's global digital map content comprises a large volume of data, which is divided into gridded sections called tiles to efficiently transmit map images for display over the Internet to multiple users simultaneously.

- The tiles are rendered at various sizes and available at 23 different zoom levels, ranging from 0 to 22.
- For zoom level 0, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level 22, the world is divided into 2<sup>44</sup> tiles.

### Satellite Tile

TomTom's global digital map content comprises a large volume of data, and to efficiently transmit satellite map images for display over the Internet simultaneously to multiple users, the data are divided into gridded sections called **tiles**.

- The tiles are available at 20 different zoom levels, ranging from `0` to `19`.
- For zoom level `0`, the entire earth is displayed on one single tile, while at zoom level `19`, the world is divided into 2<sup>38</sup> tiles.

### Hillshade Tile

The Hillshade Tile service provides an image pyramid that contains elevation data with terrain representation.
It can be used for rendering hillshade that shows the topographical shape of hills and mountains.
The data are divided into gridded sections called **tiles**.

- The tiles are available at 14 different zoom levels, ranging from `0` to `13`.
