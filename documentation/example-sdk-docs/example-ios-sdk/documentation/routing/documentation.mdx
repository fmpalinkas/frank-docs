This component integrates the Routing API service described
on [https://developer.Example.com/routing-api/documentation/routing/calculate-route](https://developer.Example.com/routing-api/documentation/routing/calculate-route). The
service calculates a route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if they
are specified.

The Routing API is one of our most advanced APIs, enabling the user to calculate a perfect path from
point A to point B.

- TTRouteQueryBuilder is used to construct a Request to the Routing API service for planning a
  route.
- You can set an origin and a destination if you want to route from the current location, then
  simply pass it to the from() method of the TTRouteQueryBuilder.
- You can set a list of via points to lead the way though them.
- You can provide locations as points, or as approximate points (circles).

Import the TTRouteResponseDelegate. Before releasing a Routing object for which you have set a
delegate, remember to set that objectâ€™s delegate property to nil.

<Code>

```swift
class RouteViewController: UIViewController, TTRouteResponseDelegate {}
```

```objectivec
@interface RouteViewController () < TTRouteResponseDelegate>
```

</Code>

Add your implementation of the protocol method completedWithResult:

<Code>

```swift
func route(_: TTRoute, completedWith result: TTRouteResult) {
}
```

```objectivec
- (void)route:(TTRoute *)route completedWithResult:(TTRouteResult *)result {
}
```

</Code>

Add your implementation of the protocol method completedWithResponseError:

<Code>

```swift
func route(_: TTRoute, completedWith responseError: TTResponseError) {
}
```

```objectivec
- (void)route:(TTRoute *)route completedWithResponseError:(TTResponseError *)responseError {
}
```

</Code>

Add a delegate on viewDidLoad:

<Code>

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    routePlanner.delegate = self
}
```

```objectivec
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad]
    self.routePlanner = [[TTRoute alloc] initWithKey:Key.Routing];
    self.routePlanner.delegate = self;
}
```

</Code>
